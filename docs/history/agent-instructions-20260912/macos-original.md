## Overview

Account follow-up: installed build 25.16 retains the compact 25.15 UI and adds checked session persistence, typed Keychain read failures, single-flight refresh and stale-result guards. 153 isolated tests and native compilation passed. Actual launch reports saved-account Keychain read denial (-25293), not a missing token. The user's explicit saved-account Keychain approval and authenticated restart acceptance remain open. Never automate passwords or enable background authentication prompts. See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for evidence.

Latest installed build: 25.15, September 5. The user rejected the 25.13 redesign, then requested the compact UI restoration, an eye drag fix and the existing engine fixes. Build 25.15 restores the dark compact composer, separate History/New chat controls and original eye, retaining app icons, readable text and request-specific loading state. Do not reintroduce the rejected unified shell or adaptive palette. Fixed overlay-space dragging, animation-free release and a common-mode pointer timer address snap-back. 134 usability tests and six inert chat-action tests passed; GUI build, native same-screen drags, edge return, close and restart position were checked. Cross-display drag and live model/edit capability are not accepted by these checks. Harness research remains separate and unmerged. See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for evidence.

September 5 current UI direction: the user approved native implementation after reviewing the workflow prototypes. Keep the existing eye artwork, geometry and motion, with its fixed colors independent of the lighter panel palette. The earlier 25.12 hold is superseded by candidate 25.13. Do not make additional standalone prototypes unless requested. Current installation and acceptance evidence is in the separately maintained implementation-status record.

Iris — the desktop assistant for publik. A text-first fork of Clicky by Farza (see NOTICE / LICENSE.upstream). macOS menu bar companion app. Lives entirely in the macOS status bar (no dock icon, no main window). Clicking the menu bar icon — or pressing the global summon hotkey (ctrl+option) — toggles a custom floating panel with a text input. The typed message + a screenshot of the user's screen(s) go to Claude; the response is shown as text in the panel. An eye overlay — Iris's eye, the same one the website draws — rides beside the pointer, watches it, and can fly to and point at UI elements Claude references on any connected monitor.

Voice features (AssemblyAI/OpenAI/Apple Speech transcription, ElevenLabs TTS) and PostHog analytics were removed in the fork.

Nothing sensitive ships in the app binary. The assistant reaches a model by exactly one of two routes: publik's funded endpoint (a Supabase-authenticated passthrough, where publik holds the Anthropic key) or the user's own Anthropic key stored in their Keychain. See "Assistant transports" below.

## Architecture

### Isolated harness lab only

September 11 follow-through candidate makes the captured verification routes
visible before Test editing, without adding a model call or granting behavior
coverage. Interrupted Undo also distinguishes actual delivered/restored app
payloads from receipt phase. An exact pending marker, source identity and full
matching backup can reconcile a swap that finished before its receipt write;
explicit resume then skips the completed app swap. Ordinary saved receipts
still cannot infer that recovery. See CURRENT_ACCEPTANCE.md for installed versus
source-only evidence.

The September 11 review-context fix includes registered authored native helper
sources, not just filenames containing .test or .spec, in final behavior review
and saved-change recheck. Code admission now defers those immutable fixture
bodies to final review so product source and dependencies retain space; this
does not credit native coverage or permit delivery. Manual test admission keeps
the prior evidence selection. The existing confined file reader and 24-file/64 KiB
limits still apply. Toolchain, generated, binary and config paths are excluded.
The independent transfer oracle remains separate from physical UI acceptance.

The next source candidate carries a transient, bounded code-admission handoff
into native final review: exact diff and selected-file digests, fresh confined
file reads and explicit omissions. Final review prioritizes complete native
assertion bodies instead of repeating the admission context. It retains strict
coverage parsing and blocks missing evidence or concrete defects. No new model
call, persisted state or larger source-context limit is introduced. Installed
and live acceptance remain separately recorded in CURRENT_ACCEPTANCE.md.

September 11 candidate separates general Ask from app Edit in the existing
composer. Two bounded in-memory drafts and attachment sets preserve unfinished
edit work when New chat enters general help. Connection loss never changes Ask
into Edit, and general chat omits implicit edit-task context. The candidate also
adds a five-minute catalog cache lifetime and explicit refresh, counts-only
usage attribution, bounded retry-review memory and non-destructive backup
admission. These source changes are not installed-app acceptance; see
`research/harness-v2/INTEGRATION_20260911.md` at the lab root.

September 11 follow-through derives coverage obligations from exact answered
product questions in the existing context projector. Stable question-derived
IDs and fail-closed collisions keep them separate from original planner
criteria. They remain transient; saved briefs/evidence and native admission
semantics are unchanged. No additional planning call is made, and the existing
32 KB projection cap applies. Current build and live acceptance remain separate
in `research/harness-v2/CURRENT_ACCEPTANCE.md` at the lab root.

Trial 13 (September 10) passed code tests but independent review found populated
table deletion on Backspace; Iris refused installation and the original note
was observed intact. Do not call word count accepted. It also exposed stale
command deduplication after a real source edit. Keep lifetime investigation
history separate from commands executed against unchanged source. Identical
structured writes must not alter timestamps or count as progress. The bounded
freshness fix and its inert regression do not establish complex-feature quality.
Current build and native acceptance are recorded in
`research/harness-v2/CURRENT_ACCEPTANCE.md` at the repository root.

Trial 12 follow-up adds one diagnostic confined-suite run after the first actual
repair write, while editing capacity remains. Its 30-second limit and exact
pre-resolved command do not admit native execution or waive final verification.
The same scrub-before-selection diagnostic excerpt preserves a useful early
line and final tail inside 2,000 characters. Executable regressions exercise
repair feedback, Stop after write, final-review reserve and absent-suite guards.
These checks are not native feature acceptance; see CURRENT_ACCEPTANCE.md.

Current September 10 acceptance supersedes historical pending statements below:
Iris Test `21484d19` completed native PlantGPT saved-change recheck, manual-test
delivery, relaunch and restart-selected Undo, alongside the earlier NitroAI
lifecycle acceptance. Recheck pins the retained staged source and uses fresh
build/review without maker or repair calls. Restart Undo validates the durable
record, receipt, registry and app/source identities before explicit Retry;
same-branch recovery detaches at the baseline while retaining the edit branch.
Graceful relaunch handles an already-running restored app without force quit.
This does not prove complex-feature reliability. See CURRENT_ACCEPTANCE.md
and LIVE_CAMPAIGN_RESULTS.md under the lab's research/harness-v2 directory.

| Recovery source | Approximate lines | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PendingEditCandidateIdentity.swift` | 236 | Pins retained staged source, index, paths, branch and base before recheck. |
| `MaintainSavedChangeRechecker.swift` | 603 | Existing candidate build/review/commit path with no new maker edits. |
| `InterruptedUndoResumeIdentity.swift` | 200 | Read-only binding of exact interrupted Test Undo source and app payloads. |

September 9 recovery candidate: `SavedEditDeliveryIdentity.swift` pins delivery
retries to the exact clean saved branch and commit, without another model edit.
`AppDeliveryReceiptStore.swift` records prepared/installed/restored app-file
delivery locations durably; prepared is not installed, and app-file restoration
does not imply restored source, documents, or successful behavior. The collapsed
`SavedAppVersionsSection.swift` exposes these records after restart. Checked
`PatchQueue.recordChecked` failures prevent automatic delivery. Standalone
receipt/delivery/retry checks and actual native acceptance remain distinct.

Installed-delivery routes split quit from launch so replacement waits for the
old process to exit. A refused quit retains the existing force-quit consent.
Launch failure reports prior-app recovery only after a successful reopening;
failed recovery stays explicit. A restored backup clears the edited-copy
installed flag. The next Iris Test candidate wires exact registered fixture
replacement and receipt-bound restore through `IrisTestAppDelivery.swift`.
No normal-app lookup is allowed. This source change is not yet installed or
accepted through the actual UI; see `research/harness-v2/LIVE_CAMPAIGN_RESULTS.md`
from the worktree root for current evidence.

September 10 integration adds source-aware receipts with streamed app-payload
digests, restart-selected Undo, and separate quit/restore/relaunch callbacks.
The delivery service and coordinator share the same receipt store. Test apps
are resolved by their exact registry paths, and their stack is detected rather
than assumed to be Electron. `HarnessModelSession` measures each serialized
candidate before admission; edit/repair requests that would consume the
independent-review allowance yield to verification without spending a call.
Intake records distinguish product choices from implementation questions and
preserve user decisions across refinements. None of these source/build checks
alone proves successful installed-app delivery or restored user behavior.

Failed model runs check actual porcelain status before claiming unchanged
source. A review-held incomplete-edit record survives dismissal and restart.
`FailedEditReviewArchive.swift` preserves its exact metadata before a new clean
run replaces the active record; it does not archive the source or app itself.
Opening runtime screenshots are sent once per edit, with relevant observations
retained as text. Later attachments are preserved and actual sent bytes remain
fully metered. Git warnings are not valid porcelain file records.
Independent review prioritizes complete test files within the collector's
existing 64 KiB ceiling, labels a diff that exceeds its 64 KiB handoff cap,
and carries bounded observed test output. A pending operator-declared native
lane is not a passed test, nor an editor-authored disabled test. Code admission
and final runtime acceptance remain distinct requirements.

September 10 follow-up keeps reviewer diagnostics in the existing bounded repair
loop. Only findings from the current rejected admission/final review may enter
repair; cancellation, registry changes and native-suite failures cannot reuse
stale findings. Scrubbing precedes truncation. One-hop source context interleaves
imports across changed files without increasing the 24-file/64 KiB ceilings.
These regressions do not themselves prove live feature installation or Undo.

September 10 live acceptance: the 9315aa46 Test candidate generated a visible
NitroAI fixture label change, packaged and replaced that isolated installed app,
and relaunched it. Root observed the new labels and preserved note through
computer use. After quitting and reopening Iris Test, Saved app versions Undo
restored the original app and clean source baseline and reopened the original
labels with the note intact. That run exposed stale forward-delivery wording
after Undo. Candidate 63ed1676 includes distinct pending/restored presentation
with state regressions, but its successful Undo message still needs fresh
computer-use acceptance. This one Electron label trial is not complex-feature
or second-stack acceptance.

The next Test-only candidate adds deterministic selected-answer presentation
from the existing revisioned task decisions, with no extra model call. Its
explicit manual-test preview is restricted to exact registered feature targets
without a resolved test command or native declaration, successful build and
clean review. Missing behavior coverage stays unverified and the automatic
delivery gate is unchanged. Preview commit and registry identity are rechecked
at click time and through packaging before quit. Not now retains the branch;
generic retry cannot silently drop the candidate's destination binding. This
source route requires native acceptance before claiming second-stack delivery.

The maker's existing command recap now permits in-sandbox test commands and
requires criterion-level executed evidence before DONE. Per-app run memory may
store an optional, scrubbed 600-character last verification failure; legacy
records remain readable and are not backfilled. Historical failure evidence
does not establish current source state. The full memory prompt retains its
1,500-character ceiling and reports only records actually serialized.

Nontechnical intake asks consequential product choices before optional details,
keeps credentials separate unless explicitly requested, and uses repository
evidence for technical decisions. Vague requests are not approval to expand the
scope to every subsystem. Real model question quality must be observed separately
from deterministic clarification state tests.
`RepoRecipeShippingEvidence.swift` uses conservative, read-only Electron
entrypoint and packaging declarations to keep leftover Tauri scaffolding from
selecting the wrong verification recipe. Explicit competing packaging routes
retain ambiguity; this is not proof that either app can be packaged or launched.

`tools/harness-feature-host` compiles a headless fixture host with
`IRIS_HARNESS_HEADLESS`. It uses the real planner/provider/editor without
constructing application, account, recovery or publishing services. The flag
isolates tracing, temporary paths and shell execution for the test host only;
it is not a normal-app preference. `HarnessFixtureEnvironment.swift` supplies
the explicit private scratch path because Foundation may ignore TMPDIR.
See that host's README for the allowed fixture and preflight/grade boundaries.
Never treat its source-level feature check as a native app installation.

The lab adds bounded written-answer refinement through `HarnessFeatureWorkflow`
and `HarnessBehaviorAssessment.swift` (about 100 lines). The latter records
reviewer-supported test references per acceptance criterion, not physical UI
proof. One budgeted repair can investigate missing coverage. Experimental
automatic delivery also requires the exact reviewed diff revision. The shared
coordinator owns its edit task through recovery; Cancel cannot reset a live edit
into another app. See `research/harness-v2/IMPLEMENTATION.md` for current evidence.

Scope-changing clarification stays pending until an exact-ID user decision.
Approval replaces obsolete criteria, limits, milestones and model assumptions;
rejection records that the earlier contract wins over a conflicting answer.
`HarnessExecutionJournal.swift` retains bounded executor observations, never
acceptance claims. `HarnessConversationProjection.swift` removes only historical
patch payloads confirmed by actual structured-edit and changed-file events.
It preserves user messages, failed edits, images and the latest two replies.
Byte accounting is not a token or cost measurement. Both remain lab-route only.
The lab provider preserves the final model call for independent review. The
executor may enter ordinary verification at that boundary without model DONE;
it earns no acceptance credit and must not retry a failed suite using the
reserve. Real-executor inert checks live in `HarnessReviewReserveChecks.swift`.
For a captured native declaration it reserves two calls: strict code admission,
then final behavior review after observed native results. Admission never earns
behavior coverage or L6 credit. `HarnessNativeVerificationSequence.swift` checks
cancellation and exact reviewed source around native execution and final review.
It authorizes no new command or permission and does not reserve input bytes.
`HarnessNativeReviewChecks.swift` exercises that sequence with inert callbacks.

Free-text answers remain unresolved until the existing refinement reply names
their pending IDs in `resolvedQuestionIDs`. Options are local decisions;
uncertain text is not approval. Changed answers advance the revision so old
evidence cannot satisfy a changed choice. Keep this in the existing workflow,
not another planner or UI panel. Live question quality and deterministic state
gates are separate checks.

Codex subprocesses own a process group. Input uses a per-descriptor SIGPIPE
guard and nonblocking, cancellable writes. Output readers have a bounded exit
wait; detached helpers cause a reported failure, not a success claim. The
offline production-path checks are in `tools/codex-provider-process-tests`.
Verification diagnostics are redacted before the final output cap. The jail
allows signals only to the same sandbox so test runners can stop their workers.

Iris Test can declare separate confined and native verification lanes for a
registered staged project. `IrisTestVerificationPlan.swift` captures that exact
operator declaration before editing. `IrisTestNativeVerification.swift` uses
fixed argv, checked executable/fixture hashes, a stripped environment and a
deadline. The native lane runs only after clean independent review, and source
must still match the reviewed diff afterward. Both lanes are required before
the suite is reported green. This is not an arbitrary-command retry outside
the jail. Native apps are same-user processes, not OS-contained; do not claim
the shell's filesystem or network restrictions apply to them. The operator's
trusted test declaration and checks are separate from model-authored code.

- **App Type**: Menu bar-only (`LSUIElement=true`), no dock icon or main window
- **Framework**: SwiftUI (macOS native) with AppKit bridging for menu bar panel and cursor overlay
- **Pattern**: MVVM with `@StateObject` / `@Published` state management
- **AI Chat**: Claude with SSE streaming, over one of two transports (funded via publik, or the user's own Anthropic key)
- **Identity**: Supabase PKCE OAuth in the system browser (`ASWebAuthenticationSession`) or email+password; no Supabase SDK, no SPM dependencies
- **Screen Capture**: ScreenCaptureKit (macOS 14.2+), multi-monitor support
- **Text Input**: The input bar under the eye, wired to `CompanionManager.sendUserMessage` — the same pipeline that previously received the final dictation transcript. The whole exchange happens in that bar; the menu bar panel is settings only. System-wide summon hotkey via listen-only CGEvent tap toggles the settings panel.
- **Element Pointing**: Claude embeds `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]` tags in responses. The overlay parses these, maps coordinates to the correct monitor, and animates the eye along a bezier arc to the target. The eye looks at the element for the whole flight and while it points, then looks back at the mouse on the way home.
- **Install Guides**: `iris://guide/<slug>?version=&branch=&step=` links from publikhq.com open a step-by-step install guide inside the panel. `GuideSessionController` owns the open guide; `GuidePanelView` draws it. Reaches parity with the guide pill the Tauri app (`iris-desktop/`) shipped.
- **App Awareness**: `AppInventoryService` knows which publik catalog apps are installed on this Mac, which version each is, whether a newer release exists, and which one is frontmost. It reads the catalog from `GET {publik}/api/iris/apps`, and reports an app publik has no `macBundleId` for as `unknown` rather than as "not installed" — see below.
- **Concurrency**: `@MainActor` isolation, async/await throughout

### Assistant transports

`docs/iris-assistant-protocol.md` in the publik repo is the authoritative contract. There are exactly two routes, and they speak the identical wire format (the Anthropic Messages API, streaming SSE), so one SSE parser serves both:

| Tier | Endpoint | Auth | Model |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| Funded | `POST {publik}/api/assistant/chat` | `Authorization: Bearer <supabase access token>` | pinned server-side; the client's `model` is ignored and therefore not sent |
| BYO (key) | `POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` | the user's own `x-api-key`, stored in the Keychain | the client's choice |
| BYO (Claude Code login) | `POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` | the user's own `sk-ant-oat…` OAuth token, as `Authorization: Bearer` + `anthropic-beta: oauth-…`, stored in the Keychain | the client's choice |

The BYO tier has two credential shapes: a pasted API key, or a **Claude Code login** connected via "CLI login" (see `ClaudeCodeLogin.swift`). A pasted key wins when both are present. `AnthropicBringYourOwnCredential` is the single resolver all three BYO consumers (chat, the Tier C provider, the crash-path fix adapter) use so the "key or token?" precedence lives in one place.

Since Aug 26 2026 there is a third credential the reader can connect, and it is deliberately unlike the other two: a **Codex CLI login** (`CodexCLILogin.swift`, `CodexMaintainProvider.swift`). Iris stores NOTHING for it — no Keychain kind — because a ChatGPT OAuth token is not an `api.openai.com` credential and cannot be used as one. Iris drives the reader's `codex` CLI instead (`codex exec`, stdin prompt, `--output-last-message`), so the CLI owns the token and its refresh. That buys a real advantage over the Claude path, which has no refresh and degrades to a 401 when an imported login lapses. It costs latency: measured live, Codex is roughly 9× slower per step than the Anthropic route, which matters because Tier C takes many steps.

**It powers Tier C only, not chat.** Both chat routes speak the Anthropic Messages wire format with tool-use blocks (§1 of `docs/iris-assistant-protocol.md`); `codex exec` cannot serve that without a translation layer and the loss of streaming. `activeTierDescription` says "app editing" for exactly this reason.

**Tier C can search the web (Aug 27 2026).** It was the one part of Iris that could not look anything up — the guide fix ladder and chat both could — and its own system prompt said "there is no network", so a reader asking it to integrate an API the model did not already know had no path that could succeed. Both arms now have search, each through its provider's own SERVER-SIDE tool: Codex via `-c tools.web_search=true` (a config override, NOT `--search`, which exists only on the top-level `codex` command — `codex exec --search` exits 2), Anthropic via the `web_search_20250305` tool already used by the fix ladder. Because the search runs on the provider's side, the local Seatbelt jail is untouched: the model gains current knowledge, the sandbox gains no network.

Giving it the tool is the easy half. Whether the model REACHES for it is what decides if any of it matters, and no prompt wording settles that — `ToolInvocationLiveTests` measures it against both arms, with scenarios where searching is obviously right, obviously wasteful, and a genuine judgement call. Codex reports tool use through `item.completed` events with `item.type == "web_search"`; Anthropic through `server_tool_use` content blocks. Both are read from the real transport, never inferred from the reply text — a model claiming it searched is not evidence that it did.

Because Codex is an *agent with its own shell*, every invocation is pinned to `--sandbox read-only --ephemeral --ignore-user-config --skip-git-repo-check`, built in one place and re-validated by `CodexExecInvocation.validated(_:)` before launch — the same belt-and-braces shape as `AssistantTransport.validatedRequest`, and asserted by tests that try a writable sandbox, `-s danger-full-access`, and a `--dangerously-*` bypass (matched by PREFIX, so a future CLI's new escape hatch is refused by default).

**NEITHER SHAPE OF THE BYO CREDENTIAL IS EVER SENT TO ANY PUBLIK HOST.** `AssistantTransport.swift` enforces this structurally (the only function that writes `x-api-key` and the only one that writes the OAuth `Authorization: Bearer` + `anthropic-beta` pair each take no URL — the destination is a constant), by assertion (`validatedRequest` refuses either credential to any host but `api.anthropic.com` — it identifies the OAuth token by its `anthropic-beta: oauth-…` header, which the funded Bearer route never carries, so the two Bearers can never be confused), and by test (`AssistantTransportTests`). Do not add a code path that accepts both a credential and a destination. The `anthropicOAuthBetaHeaderValue` is the public value Claude Code sends and is UNVERIFIED from inside Iris — if Anthropic rotates it, OAuth-token requests 401 and that constant is the fix.

The funded tier's error codes map to fixed user-visible states: `sign_in_required` (401) → prompt re-sign-in, `rate_limited` / `daily_budget_exhausted` (429 + `Retry-After`) → quota message, `assistant_unconfigured` (503) → outage, anything else → generic failure. A raw server body is never shown to the user.

The `worker/` directory is dead — a leftover from the upstream Clicky fork, kept only as a wire-format reference. The app no longer calls it.

### Key Architecture Decisions

**Menu Bar Panel Pattern**: The companion panel uses `NSStatusItem` for the menu bar icon and a custom borderless `NSPanel` for the floating control panel. This gives full control over appearance (dark, rounded corners, custom shadow) and avoids the standard macOS menu/popover chrome. The panel is non-activating so it doesn't steal focus. A global event monitor auto-dismisses it on outside clicks.

**Cursor Overlay**: A full-screen transparent `NSPanel` hosts the eye companion. It's non-activating, joins all Spaces, and never steals focus. The eye's position, mood, gaze and pointing animations all render in this overlay via SwiftUI through `NSHostingView`. The pointer is read with `NSEvent.mouseLocation` rather than an event tap, deliberately: that needs no Accessibility grant, so the eye keeps tracking on a machine where permissions are only partly granted.

**The Eye Is The Interface**: The eye is 64pt and clicking it opens the input bar under it, while the eye itself becomes a gear that opens the settings panel. The bar carries the *whole* exchange — it does not hand off to the menu bar panel, which is what it used to do. `OverlayEyeExchange` is the four-state machine it runs on: `composingTheFirstQuestion` (empty field, suggestion chips) → `waitingForIrisToAnswer` (the question echoed above a working line whose wording follows `assistantState`, so the bar and the spinning eye always agree) → `showingTheAnswer` (the answer, or the failure sentence, in the same slot, wrapped and scrolling past `tallestTheAnswerAreaMayGrow`) → `composingAFollowUp` (the answer stays up while the next question is typed). Dismissal — Escape, the ×, a click outside, or the eye leaving this screen — destroys the view, which is what makes "dismissing clears the exchange" true without anything having to remember it. Since Sep 3 2026 a click outside is decided on its RELEASE, not its press: the press is also how every drag onto the bar begins, and dismissing on it was why "i cant drag and drop screenshots into it because when i click off it closes". The bar takes a drop through SwiftUI's own `.onDrop` (`OverlayEyeBarDropDelegate` — an `NSHostingView` runs its own drag machinery on internal subviews, so an AppKit subclass never sees the drag); the release-time keep is decided separately, by any drag session starting since the press (the system drag pasteboard's change count), which turns the release into a drop instead of a dismissal. The bar also had to drop from `.screenSaver` to `.popUpMenu`: the window server never routes drag-and-drop to a window at `.screenSaver` (the drop fell through to the app behind), which is why nothing but a live run caught it — `OverlayEyeInputBarClickOutsideDismissal` is the rule, and `OverlayEyeInputBarDropTarget.swift`'s header carries the two-process CGEvent measurement it rests on (the foreign drag's mouse-up reaches the global monitor 4ms BEFORE the drop, so the release alone could never be the signal). Images reach the bar three ways — cmd-V, a drop, the paperclip button — into one bounded list (`OverlayEyePastedImageAttachment`, four at most), and ride the next message WITH the screen, never instead of it (founder ruling, Sep 3 2026: "it should read both my screen and the image"); each attachment is labelled as ATTACHED and not pointable, and the system prompt says the same.

Three rules make that safe on a window that covers the whole screen:

- **Click-through is gated, not hit-tested.** The overlay stays `ignoresMouseEvents = true` everywhere; the 60fps pointer poll opens `OverlayWindowMouseEventGate` only while the pointer is inside the eye's own ~76pt square, and shuts it again on the way out. Returning nil from a view's `hitTest(_:)` would not do — the window would still swallow the click instead of passing it to the app below. `OverlayEyeInteractionGeometry.theOverlayShouldAcceptMouseEvents` is the single decision, and `OverlayEyeClickThroughTests` sweeps the whole display against it.
- **The bar is its own window.** The overlay must never become key, so the input bar lives in a small separate `.nonactivatingPanel` (`OverlayEyeInputBarPanelManager`) that can. A non-activating panel takes keystrokes without activating Iris, so the user's app stays frontmost. Because the bar is its own window, its clicks and scrolls never travel through the overlay at all: when an answer makes the bar taller the interactive surface grows because the *panel* grew, and the overlay's gate does not move a pixel. `resizeTheBarToFit` re-places the window against the eye it hangs from, pinning the top edge so it grows downward and clamping at `tallestTheInputBarMayGrow`.
- **The bar holds the keyboard only while a question is being composed.** A panel that stays key after the question is sent goes on swallowing keystrokes meant for the app the reader went back to — real characters typed into a real editor once landed in this bar. `OverlayEyeExchange.theBarShouldHoldTheKeyboard` is the rule; `releaseTheKeyboardSoTheReadersOwnAppGetsItBack` is the mechanism (drop the first responder, turn `canBecomeKey` off, `NSApp.deactivate()`, with an `orderOut`/`orderFront` safety net) and `takeTheKeyboardBackForTheTextField` reverses it when the reader clicks back into the field. Dismissal is still an `orderOut`, which hands key status straight back.

**Global Summon Hotkey**: The background hotkey uses a listen-only `CGEvent` tap instead of an AppKit global monitor so modifier-based shortcuts like `ctrl + option` are detected more reliably while the app is running in the background. Pressing it toggles the companion panel (it previously started/stopped dictation).

**Setup Recovery Detour**: The commonest way an install fails is a prerequisite that is not there. When a branch loads, `GuideSessionController` checks the tools that branch's `setupSteps` declare; if one is missing it diverts the reader into those setup steps — explaining which tool and why — instead of dropping them on step one of an install they cannot start. A re-check ends the detour when the tool appears, and an explicit, de-emphasised skip exists for people who have it under a name the check cannot see. The detour writes nothing to progress storage: the reader's place in the guide survives it untouched, which is why `advanceToTheNextStep` refuses to run while the detour is open. A branch with a missing tool but no `setupSteps` is never diverted, because a card with no repair route is a dead end.

**Adaptive Watch Loop**: While a guide step that declares a `watch` block is open, `WatchLoop` notices that the reader has actually done it and advances the guide without being told. It is a strict cheapest-first ladder — is a watched step even open, is Iris allowed to look at all, has the screen meaningfully changed (one ~256 px grayscale capture and a 64-bit dHash), do the local signals settle it (frontmost app, window title, `ToolVersionService`, `GitInspectionService`, AX), and only then one model call for a step that declares a `visual` expectation. The model budget from `docs/iris-assistant-protocol.md` §7 (≥ 10 s apart, ≤ 8 per step) is enforced in code, and hitting the ceiling drops that step back to local signals rather than stopping the loop. Every privacy rule in §5 is a code path with a test: frames exist only as a local `let` around the one call that sends them, capture hard-suspends on secure input, a `sensitive` step is never captured at all and completes from side signals, a user-editable excluded-apps list seeded with password managers blocks capture while one is frontmost, and an indicator plus an always-immediate global pause are both derived from the loop's own state.

**Guided-install autopilot**: Iris can now run a guide's `command` steps itself instead of only displaying them for a manual copy. `GuideAutopilotRunner` drives a state machine — execute → risk gate → outcome → on failure, a fix ladder (fix from the guide material → fix informed by a web search → surface the diagnosis to the reader) → retry → advance — against a persistent pty-backed login shell, streaming output into a terminal view under the step card. Clean commands run automatically; admin, destructive, and obfuscated commands pause for an explicit "Run it" tap; network-pipe-to-shell and disk-destroying commands are refused outright and are never tappable. Autopilot starts only when the reader taps "Let Iris run it" in the panel — reachable through `performPrimaryAction` and never from an `iris://` deep link, which can preselect a guide and step but cannot start execution. Executed commands come only from the HTTPS-fetched, version-pinned guide JSON (status `pilot`/`approved`); a step with `watch.sensitive: true` is never executed, echoed, or sent to a model, and falls back to the copy-by-hand card. All model-bound terminal output is secret-scrubbed on egress. The panel no longer auto-collapses while a guide is open — a click-off or the eye moving off-screen no longer tears it down; only the × or End does. Everything here is budget-latched per `docs/iris-assistant-protocol.md` §8 (2 fix attempts/step) — and the per-guide ceilings (6 fix attempts / 8 model calls) now apply only while the ladder is spending publik's funded tier. On the reader's own credential publik has nothing to protect, so the ladder runs on under a PROGRESS guard instead (`GuideAutopilotFixLadderFunding`, five consecutive steps spent on without getting one running); when publik's budget runs out mid-install and the reader has connected their own Anthropic credential, Iris carries on with theirs rather than stopping. The fallback is Anthropic-only because the ladder needs a forced `propose_fix` tool_use, which `codex exec` cannot serve.

The terminal's red traffic light is a real button — the escape hatch (`GuideSessionController.abortOrCloseAutopilotFromTheEscapeHatch`). It CLOSES, in every state, killing whatever is still running on the way out (the abort is enqueued before `stopAutopilot`'s own `endSession`, so the process group is SIGKILLed while its shell still exists — `endSession` closes the shell politely and a heavy build ignores polite). Autopilot stops, the takeover folds away, and the guide stays open where the reader left it, so closing costs them their automation and never their place. It used to mean two different things and both read as broken (founder report, Aug 30 2026: "the traffic light doesn't actually work, it's not functional"): a `guard autopilotIsRunning` returned silently whenever autopilot had already stopped under a takeover still on screen, and mid-drive it aborted the STEP and left the window standing — which is not the narrow "a command is running" window it sounds like, because `autopilotIsDriving` is true for the WHOLE drive loop and a manual gate parks inside it. At the moment a reader most wanted out, the close button closed nothing. It exists because a hung step once left a reader no way out short of shutting the Mac down. The transcript itself scrolls and follows its own tail for the same incident's other half: it used to be a plain stack in a fixed window, so an install longer than the window kept "running" below the clip — exit lines, fixes, and the Your-turn buttons all rendering where nothing could see or reach them.

When Iris reaches a step it cannot clear on its own — the ladder gives up, or the reader skips a risky command — it does not stop the whole install. It *hands the step back*: `autopilotOwnsTheCurrentStep` goes false, which un-muzzles the watch loop so it can notice the reader finished that one step and advance, resuming the install for the rest; the eye re-points at the step; and a "Your turn" row in the terminal offers Try again (re-run the step) or Continue past it (skip and carry on). Before this a single un-clearable gate stalled the whole run. The terminal is also paced so a complex install reads as deliberate work rather than an instant flash: each command is typed out, a block cursor blinks while it runs, and a command that finishes faster than `GuideAutopilotPacing.minimumVisibleCommandDuration` (0.7s) has its result line held that long — the shell itself is never slowed, and a command that already runs longer gets no hold, so real installs are untouched.

*Key Files (all in `iris-macos/leanring-buddy/`):*

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `GuideAutopilotPseudoTerminal.swift` | The only file that touches `openpty`/`posix_spawn`. Spawns the shell with `POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID` so the pty becomes its controlling terminal — real job control, real Ctrl-C — without `fork()`ing inside a Cocoa process. |
| `GuideAutopilotShellSession.swift` | One persistent login shell per guide session, so later steps see earlier steps' `cd`/env changes. Drives it through a generated `ZDOTDIR` that loads the user's real dotfiles and then disables ZLE, so programmatic command injection is reliable. |
| `GuideAutopilotOutputBuffer.swift` | Holds command output in two shapes: an unbounded-looking display ring for the terminal view, and a short, ANSI-stripped, secret-scrubbed tail for anything sent to a model. |
| `GuideAutopilotCommandShape.swift` | Pure text analysis of a command — does it hold the shell open (dev servers, watchers), does it ever return — with no execution and no risk judgment of its own. |
| `GuideAutopilotRiskAssessment.swift` | The gate every command passes before the shell runs it. Without the autonomy grant: three tiers (auto-run, confirm-tap, refuse-outright) for guide commands and model-proposed fixes alike. With the grant (see below): everything runs hands-off EXCEPT a narrow **catastrophe floor** (`catastropheRules` — whole-disk/whole-home destruction, `mkfs`, `dd` to a raw disk, a fork bomb) that is refused even under the grant. `assess(_:autonomyGranted:)` defaults `autonomyGranted` to the persisted grant, so the runner honors it with no value threaded through. Every pattern literal stays in the source — `tests/iris-guides.test.ts` greps this file for them. A guardrail against mistakes, not an adversarial sandbox — provenance (HTTPS-fetched, version-pinned guide JSON) is the real boundary. |
| `AutopilotAutonomyGrant.swift` | The one persisted "Let Iris take control of your Mac?" consent (`UserDefaults`, `nonisolated`, injectable for tests). Granted once — via the modal `CompanionManager` shows on the first "Let Iris run it" tap (`GuideSessionController.confirmAutonomousControl` → `startAutopilot`) — it is remembered across installs and revocable from the settings panel (`autopilotAutonomyRow`). It never waves through the catastrophe floor, and the terminal's red escape hatch still stops any running install. Covered by `AutopilotAutonomyTests.swift`. |
| `GuideAutopilotFixProposer.swift` | On a failing command, assembles the step/command/exit status/scrubbed output and asks the model for one structured fix via a forced `propose_fix` tool call — material-only first, then with Anthropic's server-side `web_search` if the first fix also fails. No screenshot ever rides along. |
| `GuideAutopilotRunner.swift` | The state machine described above: owns the budgets, the transcript, and published state, reaching the world only through injected collaborators so it is testable without a pty or network. |
| `GuideAutopilotTranscript.swift` | The terminal view's data model — pure values only, so the runner is testable without a UI. Distinguishes a guide command from a model fix by rule colour, label, and indent. |
| `GuideAutopilotTerminalView.swift` | The SwiftUI terminal shown under the guide step card, dressed as a real macOS Terminal window (traffic-light title bar, solid dark body, a `%` prompt, a block cursor that blinks while a command runs, and each command typed out as if entered by hand — the real shell is never slowed, only the way it is shown). For a non-technical reader each command row leads with a plain-English label (`GuideAutopilotFriendlyLabel`; a fix uses the model's own `whatItDoes`) with the raw command shown de-emphasised beneath it, and the running line shows a real spinner + "Working…". Renders the transcript, the confirm row ("Run it") when a risky command is waiting, and a "Your turn" surface row (Try again / Continue past it) when Iris hands a step back. The transcript scrolls and auto-follows its own tail, and the red traffic light is the escape hatch (see above). The takeover panels sit at `.floating` (`takeoverWindowLevel`), deliberately not `.screenSaver`: above every ordinary window, but BELOW system dialogs — at screenSaver the dim scrim covered macOS TCC permission prompts fired mid-run, which rendered invisibly behind it and read as a hang (founder report, Aug 22 2026). |
| `GuideAutopilotTakeoverPanel.swift` | The centered "takeover" the install runs in. When the reader taps "Let Iris run it", `GuideAutopilotTakeoverController` dims the desktop (a click-through backdrop panel, so a manual sub-step can still reach the app underneath) and morphs the eye into a centered macOS-Terminal window — a small non-activating panel that grows from eye-size while a SwiftUI cross-fade (`GuideAutopilotTakeoverView`, wrapping `GuideAutopilotTerminalView` verbatim) swaps the eye face for the terminal — then folds it back into the eye on completion. The Swift port of the Windows renderer's eye→terminal→eye morph. `CompanionManager` raises it from `onAutopilotDidStart`, tears it down from `onAutopilotDidStop`/`onGuideCompleted`, and `GuideSessionController.autopilotIsShownAsTakeover` hides the under-the-card pane while it is up so the terminal is never drawn twice. On a **manual step** (a download, drag, permission, or sign-in the risk gate won't let Iris run — including a guide whose very first step is manual), the drive loop points the eye at the step's control and fires `onAutopilotWaitingForReaderAtGate`, which `parkForManualStep()` answers by sliding the terminal to the bottom-right corner (the top-right is the browser download chip, plus notifications and Control Center) and lifting the dim, so the eye and the control are both in the clear. The terminal is draggable by its whole body — `GuideAutopilotTakeoverTerminalPanel` holds every left mouse-down and moves the window itself past a 3pt slop, because `isMovableByWindowBackground` alone is refused by the `SelectionTextField` SwiftUI backs each selectable transcript line with; a press that does not travel is handed back intact so the card's buttons still click, and the drag is clamped so the title strip (and its red escape hatch) can never be pushed off every display. Once the reader has moved it Iris may resize it but leaves its top-left corner where they dropped it for the rest of the run; the watch loop auto-detects completion (no click) and `onAutopilotResumedFromGate` → `returnToCenter()` brings it back before the next command. |
| `ClaudeSSEMessageAccumulator.swift` | Pure, line-at-a-time reconstruction of one Messages-API SSE response — text deltas, reassembled `tool_use` input JSON, and full content blocks for a `pause_turn` resend. Used by the fix ladder's `propose_fix` calls. Also collects the turn's `AssistantTokenUsage` for the spend ledger, because it is the one place every SSE event of a tool-carrying turn already passes through. |
| `AssistantSpendLedger.swift` | What the reader's own API key has spent — per query in the eye bar, cumulatively in the settings panel. Replaces a cap rather than adding to one (founder ruling, Aug 30 2026: a reader paying their own bill already has their provider's limits, and what was missing was never a ceiling but the number). ONLY metered routes are counted: publik's funded tier is not the reader's money, and a Claude Code login and the Codex CLI are flat-rate plans whose marginal cost per query is zero, so pricing their tokens would invent a bill. The price table is hardcoded published rates and WILL go stale — a model it does not know costs `nil`, never `0`, and the total then renders as "at least $X"; a silent $0.00 would understate what somebody spent. `AssistantSpendLedger.shared` is a weak sink so the Tier C providers, built inside a static factory nothing can hand an instance to, report to the same ledger. |

`ToolInvocationLiveTests.swift` (~330 lines) makes real, billed calls and is gated on `IRIS_TOOL_INVOCATION=1`, like the parity and battery harnesses. It exists because the field failure it came from was not "the tool is missing" but "the agent did not reach for it", and that is only visible by observation.

PTY tests (`GuideAutopilotShellSessionTests.swift`) spawn a real shell and are `.serialized` — run them with `-parallel-testing-enabled NO`, or set `IRIS_SKIP_PTY_TESTS=1` to skip on a box where spawning processes is unwelcome.

**On-demand edit (user-initiated)**: The reader picks an installed catalog app from the settings panel's "Edit this app" (or the eye bar's "fix a bug in… / add a feature to…" chips), says what to change, and Iris edits the local source, verifies it, and commits it on a branch — all under the reader's OWN model key. It is the second door into the SAME `MaintainTierCFixer` jailed loop the crash path drives (`attemptOnDemandEdit`, prompt/trailer/branch parameterized by a `MaintainEditTask`), with crash detection skipped entirely; there is no pooled recipe for an arbitrary request, so it routes through Tier C only. `OnDemandEditCoordinator` owns the phase machine and does NOT inherit the incident coordinator's ask throttle/mute (that exists to stop AI nagging — wrong for an act the reader started). The run is watched in the guide autopilot's eye→terminal takeover, reused by generalizing `GuideAutopilotTerminalView`/`GuideAutopilotTakeoverController` over an `AutopilotTerminalPresenting` protocol that both `GuideAutopilotRunner` and the new `OnDemandEditRunner` satisfy — no faked guide.

Since the transparency + cancel pass (Aug 21 2026, founder request), the run is no longer a black box: the engine emits `MaintainTierCProgressEvent`s (the real jailed command about to run, its real exit + a scrubbed output tail, rate-limit waits, the verification build/test commands, the commit), which the coordinator streams into the takeover terminal as real command rows and into `statusLine` as a live "what Iris is doing right now" line. The same pass surfaces the AGENT itself, not just its shell: the on-demand system prompts (crash path verbatim-unchanged) append `onDemandNarrationPromptAddendum`, so the model leads every reply with one plain-English sentence of intent — streamed as `agentNarration` events (`narrationText` strips the fenced command/DONE) — and the no-progress detector was refactored from a single SHA fingerprint to a per-file `workingTreeFileStates` snapshot (same path|size|mtime sensitivity), whose diff now also NAMES the files each step wrote/created/deleted, emitted as `editedFiles` events ("Changed: src/settings.tsx") since `.git` is stripped mid-loop and cannot be asked.

Two convergence/diagnosis fixes from the first real dogfood failure (Aug 22 2026, a run killed at step 21 "couldn't converge"): (1) the no-progress detector no longer kills a run on its first stall — a post-edit reading spree (the agent checking its own finished work) gets `convergenceNudgeMessage` folded into the last result turn ("reply DONE now, or make the next edit"; folding keeps user/assistant alternation) with the counter reset, and only a model that stalls AGAIN is stopped, one threshold later; (2) every run now persists a plain-text transcript via `OnDemandEditRunLog` to `~/Library/Logs/Iris/edit-runs/` (the request, narration, commands, exits + output tails, nudges, outcome — the same content the terminal displayed, pruned to the newest 20 runs), because the conversation used to live only in memory and a failed run left nothing to inspect (`iris.log` is structure-only by rule and stays that way). The failure card and terminal both point at the log.

From the second dogfood failure (Aug 22, whimprflow: the agent found the right accessibility fix but expressed it via a new crate — one Cargo.toml line — and the end-of-run build-script guard discarded all 46 steps): the model is now TOLD the constraint up front (`onDemandBuildScriptConstraintAddendum`, mirroring `MaintainBuildScriptGuard`'s list: no build-file edits, no new dependencies, bindings inline), and a forbidden edit is corrected AT THE STEP IT HAPPENS — the loop restores that one file from the intact `.git` backup (`git --git-dir=<backup> --work-tree=. checkout`; an untracked new file is deleted), emits `revertedForbiddenBuildScriptEdit`, folds a steer into the last result turn, and re-baselines the snapshot. Capped at `maximumBuildScriptRestoresPerRun` (2); a third strike fails fast with the same honest blocked reason. The end-of-run guard is unchanged and still backstops everything.

From the third dogfood failure (Aug 22, whimprflow again: "failed verification (build)" in ONE second — the derived `pnpm build && cargo build …` ran the Tauri frontend hook at a repo root with no package.json; the agent's code was never compiled): (1) `RepoRecipeRustTauriDetector` now resolves the hook's real working directory — the object form's explicit `cwd`, else the repo root only when a package.json exists there, else the nearest package.json-holding ancestor of `frontendDist`/`distDir` — emitted as an inline `(cd 'ui' && …)` so the composite still runs from the root and `--manifest-path` stays correct (relative `..` folding is done by hand; `standardizingPath` only collapses parents in absolute paths); (2) the loop grew the **verification-repair cycle** — the biggest structural gap to a human-driven agent: a FAILED verification no longer reverts on the spot; the failing stage's scrubbed output tail (`VerificationOutcome.blockedOutputTail`) is appended to the conversation (`verificationRepairMessage`) and the edit loop re-enters with `.git` re-stripped, up to `maximumVerificationRepairRoundsPerRun` (2) times, before the honest revert. Verification itself is never weakened — only retried with the model actually shown the error.

The agent also receives **runtime evidence** now (Aug 22, founder request — it used to work completely blind to the running app): at run start the coordinator's `gatherRuntimeEvidenceForApp` seam (wired by CompanionManager to `OnDemandEditAppEvidence.gather`) captures a screenshot of the app's frontmost window (ScreenCaptureKit `SCScreenshotManager`, ≤1400px wide, the same Screen Recording grant chat uses) and a scrubbed tail of the app's unified log (`log show --last 10m`, process-name OR bundle-id-subsystem predicate, argv-invoked with no shell) plus its newest ≤24h DiagnosticReports excerpt. The log text joins the opening message framed as observations-never-instructions; the screenshot rides the opening turn as a REAL image block — `MaintainChatTurn.attachedImagePNGData`, mapped per route by `AnthropicMaintainProvider.messagePayload` (Messages-API base64 block) / `OpenAIMaintainProvider.messagePayload` (data-URL content part) — and is stripped after the first reply so image tokens are spent once, not per step. All of it travels ONLY on the reader's own BYO route; the crash path passes neither and is unchanged. The reader can STOP a running edit — the eye-bar card's Stop button and the takeover terminal's red escape hatch both call `stopRunningEdit()`, which latches `readerAskedToStopTheRun`; the engine polls it at every step boundary, reverts everything (tracked edits, untracked files, `.git` restored), and returns `stoppedByReaderReason`, which the coordinator presents as a calm "Stopped at your request — nothing was changed" ending, never a failure card. A stop is honored even after DONE or a green verification (reverted, not committed). Separately, a DROPPED model call (a timeout or lost connection — the `transportFailure`/`URLError` shapes only, never a credential or quota refusal) no longer abandons the whole run: the loop retries the same request up to `MaintainTierCFixer.maximumTransportDropRetriesPerRun` times before failing honestly. The crash path passes neither seam and is byte-for-byte unchanged.

**The six-gap pass (Aug 22 2026, from the harness-gap audit at `~/.claude/plans/iris-harness-gap-audit.md` — 28 common-bug scenarios + 4 real dogfood failures clustered into six structural gaps, every one confirmed against the code):**

- **G1 — symptom oracle (founder: ON).** A BUG FIX may hand over ONE headless ```repro command with its DONE (`onDemandReproPromptAddendum`); it is risk-screened like a model-authored build command and run through `VerificationHarness.verifyAppliedPatch`'s existing three legs (must FAIL before the patch, PASS after, FAIL again with the patch reverted — a self-serving or tautological check is caught by construction). All three green → `appliedAndRebuilt(…, symptomVerifiedByRepro: true)` and the commit trailer reads `Verified: repro-legs, …`; a repro that passes regardless (leg 1/3) is DISCARDED and the change stays "Applied" — a bad check never blocks a good fix; a repro that fails AFTER the patch (leg 2) is real information and routes into the repair cycle. A feature never runs one. The honesty tripwire test (`theResultTypeDefaultsToUnverifiedAndHasNoStandaloneVerifiedCase`) pins that the flag defaults false and no standalone verified case exists.
- **G2 — system-state probes.** `MaintainDiagnosticProbe.promptSection` tells the agent it may interrogate the machine before localizing (`codesign -dvvv`, `spctl`, `plutil -p`, `defaults read`, `sfltool dumpbtm`, `lipo`/`otool`, `sqlite3 integrity_check`, `launchctl getenv PATH`, `sample`/`lsof`, and `log show --predicate … --info`); the Seatbelt profile gained `process-info-pidinfo`/`process-info-listpids` (still no network, writes still repo-confined); the built-in log evidence now ORs `com.apple.TCC` + `com.apple.syspolicy` and passes `--info`; the crash-report excerpt is a termination-region extraction, not a blind prefix.
- **G3 — manifest channel (founder: per-run consent).** The model still NEVER writes a build file. It may DECLARE one change in a ```manifest JSON block (`MaintainManifestChangeRequest`: addCargoDependency / addNodeDependency / addInfoPlistKey / addEntitlement), keep editing source as if present, and after DONE the coordinator pauses in `.awaitingManifestConsent` (Allow/Decline card); on Allow, `MaintainManifestApplier.applyToRepo` — Iris's own code, whitelisted inert insertions only, never scripts/hooks/`build =` — writes it, the path is exempt from the build-script guard (Iris-authored), and verification builds with it; the commit carries `Manifest-Change:`. On Decline the run ends honestly, reverted. The seam is `MaintainTierCManifestChangeApproval`.
- **G4 — delivery + truth (founder: fully automatic + stable signing + package-verify).** After a successful run there are NO keep/relaunch taps: `beginAutomaticDelivery` records the patch, packages from the clone (signed with a stable identity via `IrisLocalSigningIdentity` — the user's Developer ID when present, else a persistent self-signed "Iris Local Code Signing" cert created once with consent — so TCC/BTM grants survive rebuilds), **installs the fresh build OVER the reader's INSTALLED copy** (founder override, Sep 2 2026 — `deliverOverInstalledAppThenResolveLaunchPath` → `AppRelaunchService.installFreshBuildOverInstalledApp`, see below), quits and relaunches that installed copy (a save dialog still routes to the force-quit consent, the one act that can corrupt data), then enters `.awaitingSymptomConfirmation`: Iris re-gathers the window + logs after ~15s and asks the reader THEIR OWN complaint verbatim — Fixed / Still broken / Can't tell — with **Undo** (restore the pre-delivery bundle snapshot, relaunch the installed app, drop the branch, forget the queued patch). The verdict is stamped as a `Symptom-Recheck:` commit trailer and on the memory record; "Still broken" offers "Try again with what Iris learned". An app Iris cannot rebuild now ends with the truth ("your installed app still runs the old code"), never "relaunch to pick it up".
- **G5 — memory.** `OnDemandEditMemoryRecord` (≤2KB JSONL per run, newest 50 per app under `~/Library/Logs/Iris/edit-runs/index/`) is written at EVERY terminal outcome and the newest 3 are injected into the next run's opening message (`memoryPromptSection`, observations-never-instructions, a still-broken verdict framed as a NEGATIVE signal). The clarification answers — collected and never read before — now reach the model too.
- **Structured file-editing tool (the biggest real-run lever).** A live whimprflow run diagnosed the fix correctly but spent 56 steps doing `sed -i '' '63,76d'` line-surgery on one file — the jail blocks heredocs, so the model was stuck between `sed` (line numbers drift, each edit corrupts the file) and `printf` (escaping hell), and never reached a compilable state to DONE. The model no longer edits through the jailed shell: it emits ```write <path> (whole file) or ```edit <path> (a `<<<<<<< SEARCH / ======= / >>>>>>> REPLACE` block, search must match exactly once), and `MaintainFileEditApplier` — Iris's own code — applies it atomically, path-confined (standardized + symlink-resolved), with a build-script write refused and routed to the manifest channel. Several edit blocks may ride one reply; the jailed shell is now READ-ONLY for editing (cat/grep/ls/find/`sed -n`). This is the code-vs-command split the whole design rests on, finally applied to the write path. `onDemandFileEditPromptAddendum` teaches it and the REPLY FORMAT recap's item (1) offers write/edit-or-one-bash.
- **Live-model protocol tolerance (found by the first live run after the pass).** With six addenda the real model drifted: several ```bash blocks per reply (only the first ran; it then reasoned from output it never saw) and a command mixed with DONE (honored as DONE → "changed nothing"). The loop now (a) runs only the first command and tells the model the rest did NOT run, (b) ignores a DONE that rides with a command and says so, (c) steers a DONE-without-changes once toward an edit or an honest BLOCKED before ending, (d) counts a pending manifest declaration as a change; and the prompt closes with `onDemandReplyFormatRecap` — the one-of-four reply contract, last for recency — plus "work only inside this repository; smallest change". A live end-to-end run (real model, real jail, scratch repo) then landed `Verified: repro-legs, build-green, suite-green` with the model's own repro clearing all three legs.
- **G6 — honest refusal.** `BLOCKED: <sentence>` (+ optional `QUESTION: <sentence>`) is a terminal verb (`onDemandBlockedPromptAddendum`): rejected with a steer before any investigation, honored after — everything reverts and `.blockedByModel(explanation:questionForUser:)` reaches the card, which shows the sentences verbatim with an answer field; "Answer and retry" re-enters describe with the answer folded into the request. Also: `MaintainTierCFixer.fencedBlocks` is the ONE fence scanner for commands/repro/manifest, so a tagged block is never mistaken for a shell command.

Every safety rail is ON and non-optional: eligibility is fail-closed and re-checked LIVE at start (guide-source-clone provenance + `GitInspectionService.allowedRepositoryPath` + a BYO key + the Seatbelt jail + a real rebuild recipe), never trusting the advisory `isLocallyEditable` render flag; a per-clonePath `MaintainClonePathLock` mutually excludes the crash-incident path from the same tree (both `.git`-strip, so they must never race); a dirty working tree is refused rather than `git clean -fd`-ing the reader's own files; a model edit to a build-script file (`MaintainBuildScriptGuard`) is hard-blocked BEFORE the un-jailed verification build could run it; consent is staged per destructive act (start → preview keep/discard → destructive relaunch → force-quit), never one tap; a FEATURE is only ever "applied and rebuilt", NEVER "verified" (the engine is structurally incapable of elevating it — the result type has no verified case); sharing defaults to fork-only in the reader's own namespace (`GitHubForkService.backUp`, never `propagateFix` to a third party's main), and any public write (fix-log, `implementedCount`) is a separate every-time consent (D6). Since Sep 3 2026 (founder ruling) a confirmed-working edit acts on its own, and the fix/feature split lives in one pure function (`OnDemandEditCoordinator.aWorkingEditOpensAPullRequest(forKind:)`). A BUG FIX opens a PULL REQUEST — never a merge, even on the reader's own repo — automatically: on the reader's "Fixed" tap anywhere, and on Iris's own re-check only where the reader can push (a machine's opinion is not grounds for a PR on somebody else's project); otherwise the done card offers "Open a pull request". `OnDemandEditPullRequestOpener` tries the connected GitHub App (`GitHubForkService.openPullRequest`, dormant until the App's client id ships) and falls back to the reader's own signed-in `gh` (push, then `gh pr create`; Iris stores nothing), and the PR body names the verdict that opened it. A FEATURE is NEVER PR'd ("not auto pr for edit, only for bug fixes") — a model-authored feature has no correctness oracle to review against; instead, once it works, it is CHANGELOGGED to publik (`MaintainPoolClient.recordChangelog` → `POST /api/iris/changelog`, anonymous, and the pooled request marked implemented), a db record distinct from the D6-consented "Share to publik" public-listing post. `changelogState`/`pullRequestState` are mutually exclusive per kind; the done card shows one or the other. A dirty tree is still refused — but one left by Iris's OWN interrupted run (the Sep 3 2026 WhimprFlow orphan: a quit on the manifest-consent card after the engine had written two files) is reverted at launch and at quit from an on-disk record of what the engine touched (`OnDemandEditInterruptedRunRecovery`), and when the reader's own work is mixed in, the refusal names which files were Iris's instead of blaming the reader. Delivery now REPLACES the reader's installed copy in place (founder override, Sep 2 2026 — supersedes the old Option-A "never touch the installed app" rule): `AppRelaunchService.installFreshBuildOverInstalledApp` finds the installed bundle by id EXCLUDING the clone's build output (prefers /Applications), snapshots it to Application Support for undo, `ditto`-stages the fresh build beside it, and swaps it in atomically with `FileManager.replaceItemAt` — falling back to launching the build-dir artifact when there is no separate installed copy or the swap fails, and disclosing when a differing signature may reset TCC grants. It is UNVERIFIED until exercised on a real machine. The commit/branch/trailer spine is factored into `MaintainFixCommit`, shared with `RecipeReplayEngine` and the crash path. Pure-logic + engine coverage in `OnDemandEditTests.swift` (the engine suite is `.serialized` and sandbox-gated, like the pty tests).

**The Test 9/10 fix round (Sep 3 2026, from the cofounder's Iris 0.9.6/0.9.7 reports).** Nine field bugs, each with a `Bug<N>…ReproTests.swift` that fails on the unfixed code and a `Bug<N>…EndToEndTests.swift` that drives the real path (real panels and events, real pty shells with real bun/pnpm/node, real git repos) and fails with the fix reverted. Run these with `-parallel-testing-enabled NO`, like the PTY tests: they drive real windows, animations and shells, and in parallel two of them can time out on main-actor contention (all 60 pass serially):
- **Takeover Close/Help dead (Bug 1):** `NativeTooltipView` in `DesignSystem.swift` was a plain overlay `NSView` with no `hitTest → nil`, so it swallowed clicks on exactly the two controls that carry `.nativeTooltip` — Close and Help. It now passes clicks through like its cursor-view siblings.
- **Minimize (Bug 2):** the yellow light is a real control; it folds the takeover away (`dismiss` without `stopAutopilot`/`stopRunningEdit`) while the run continues, and the guide's under-the-card pane takes over.
- **Stale PATH (Bug 3):** the persistent guide shell re-sources the reader's dotfiles (`GuideAutopilotShellSession.reloadTheReadersEnvironment…`) before a retry and before each step, so a tool installed mid-run is found without relaunching Iris.
- **"Edit this app" showed nothing (Bug 4):** `OverlayEyeInputBar`'s "the centered takeover is covering the screen" flag stayed true for a guide PARKED at a manual step, hiding the edit card. The card now shows whenever the reader picked an app, and a refusal is shown rather than swallowed.
- **Dirty-clone loop + esbuild approval (Bug 5):** package-manager churn (`pnpm-workspace.yaml` build-approval rewrites, lockfiles) is Iris-owned in the dirty-tree gate, and the Tauri verification hook runs `pnpm install --config.dangerously-allow-all-builds=true` first, so a fresh clone builds and the tree is clean afterwards.
- **No image in an edit request (Bug 6):** the opening turn now carries a capture of the reader's screen alongside the app-window shot, with prompt wording that says exactly what is attached (`OnDemandEditAppEvidence`, `MaintainTierCFixer`).
- **Missing tool → advice only (Bug 7):** on exit 127 for a tool `ToolVersionService` knows, the runner first re-runs the guide's own install step for that tool (or a trusted official installer), reloads the shell environment, and retries once, before the model ladder.
- **Xcode gate with Xcode installed (Bug 8):** an `open` step whose watch expects `foregroundApp <bundleId>` is satisfied by activating the app when it is already installed; `AssistantMachineFacts` reports installed iOS Simulator runtimes (measured off the main actor by `CompanionManager`) so chat stops guessing at device pickers.
- **Pointing double-fire / stale coordinates (Bug 9):** pointing dispatches for the same step are coalesced by a dispatch counter, and a captured target is re-read against the window's current AX frame before the flight when the window moved.

**The Publik Test 2 fix round (Sep 3 2026, from the cofounder's Iris 0.9.8 report — `Publik Test 2 Bugs`).** Four field bugs, each with a `PublikTest2…ReproTests.swift`:
- **Mid-prompt draft lost on click-off:** "it doesn't save my prompt if I click off while mid-prompting." The bar's composer (`typedMessage` — the ask field AND, while an app is open for editing, the describe field) is a plain `@State` destroyed on every dismissal. `OverlayEyeInputBarDraftStore` (one per `CompanionManager`, IN MEMORY — an unsent draft is deliberately never written to disk) now holds it: the bar seeds the composer from it on open and mirrors the field into it on every change, so a dismissal preserves an unsent request and — because sending clears the field — a sent one leaves nothing behind.
- **Whole-Mac freeze + beeping while "certifying the fix":** the first-run "create a local signing certificate" consent (`IrisLocalSigningIdentity`, raised during the delivery rebuild that certifies a fix) was an `NSAlert.runModal()` that — unlike the two sibling consent alerts — never lifted itself above Iris's full-screen `.screenSaver` eye overlay, so it opened BEHIND it: the modal loop ran against a window the reader could not see or reach, every event beeped, and the Mac read as frozen until a hard restart. The lift is now one tested helper, `IrisOverlayModalAlert.liftAboveTheEyeOverlay`, that all three consent alerts route through so no future alert can forget it.
- **Minimize is one-way for an on-demand edit:** "Minimize button works, but I can't get the terminal back up." The Test 9/10 minimize folds the takeover away and tears its panels down; a GUIDE keeps a terminal inline afterward, but an on-demand EDIT had none — only a compact status card, with no way back. `CompanionManager.reopenOnDemandEditTakeoverTerminal()` (gated on `.running` by the pure `aMinimizedOnDemandEditTerminalMayBeReopened`) re-presents it, driven by a new "Show terminal" button on the running card; the run never stopped, so the same `editRunner` streams straight back.
- **Tauri packaging failed on `bundle_dmg.sh`:** "Iris couldn't build a runnable copy of WhimprFlow (the packaging build failed: … bundle_dmg.sh)." `packageFreshBuildFromClone` guarded on the build's EXIT CODE first, so a `tauri build` that bundled the `.app` cleanly and then failed only at the `.dmg` step (which drives Finder over AppleScript and fails headless) aborted the whole delivery — the fix Iris made was never installed, and the edit read as still-broken. The rule is now the pure `AppRelaunchService.packagingVerdict`: a FRESH launchable `.app` (mtime ≥ build start) wins over the exit code — Iris installs the `.app` and never touches the `.dmg` — and only when no fresh `.app` was produced does the exit code (and its error tail) decide the failure. This likely unblocks the WhimprFlow edit-delivery pipeline the earlier "still-broken" feature edits died in. (`Cue "not given permission to answer Iris"` was triaged as WORKING AS INTENDED — Iris reached Cue, whose report said `canRead == false`; the card correctly says to enable Assistant access in Cue's settings.)

Also from Publik Test 2, a requested SETTING: **"Edit terminal → Start minimized"** (`EditTerminalStartMinimizedPreference`, a two-button row in the settings panel next to the autonomy row). Off by default; when on, an on-demand edit starts without the centered takeover and the reader reopens it with the running card's "Show terminal" button. Scoped to edits, not guides.

**Transient Cursor Mode**: When the cursor is toggled off, submitting a message fades in the cursor overlay for the duration of the interaction (capture → response → optional pointing), then fades it out automatically after 1 second of inactivity.

## Key Files

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `HarnessNativeVerificationSequence.swift` | ~460 | Declared native check ordering, bounded route context, source-bound admission handoff and registered helper-source selection. Strict source admission, cancellation/revision checks, native execution and final evidence review. No command authorization or behavior oracle. |
| `leanring_buddyApp.swift` | ~157 | Menu bar app entry point. Uses `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor` with `CompanionAppDelegate` which creates `MenuBarPanelManager` and starts `CompanionManager`. No main window — the app lives entirely in the status bar. Receives every `iris://` link via `application(_:open:)`, parses it with `IrisDeepLinkParser`, and hands a guide link to `GuideSessionController`. |
| `CompanionManager.swift` | ~1673 | Central state machine. Owns summon hotkey monitoring, screen capture, the `AccountService`, the Claude API, overlay management, maintain mode, and the on-demand edit coordinator. Tracks assistant state (idle/capturing/thinking/pointing), conversation history, model selection, and cursor visibility. Coordinates the typed message → screenshot → Claude → text response → pointing pipeline via `sendUserMessage`, and maps transport failures to user-visible text. |
| `MenuBarPanelManager.swift` | ~302 | NSStatusItem + custom NSPanel lifecycle. Creates the menu bar icon, manages the floating companion panel (show/hide/toggle/position), installs click-outside-to-dismiss monitor. Observes `.clickyTogglePanel` posted on summon hotkey press, `.clickyShowPanel` posted when a guide link arrives, and `.clickyResizePanelToContent` posted when the panel's SwiftUI content changes height on its own. |
| `CompanionPanelView.swift` | ~1000 | Iris's **settings**, hosted in the menu bar dropdown: assistant status, model picker (Sonnet/Opus), the account section (sign in with Google/GitHub, email+password, your own Anthropic key, or **CLI login** — "Sign in with Claude Code" runs `setup-token` in an inline terminal, "Import login" reuses an existing `claude login`), the installed publik apps, permissions UI, and quit button. The BYO-credential section (`bringYourOwnCredentialSection`) shows in BOTH the signed-out and signed-in account states — a signed-in reader still needs their own model to edit apps, and this is where the on-demand-edit refusal's "Open settings" button lands them. Hands the whole panel over to `GuidePanelView` while a guide is open. Asking/answering happen in the bar under the eye, not here. Dark aesthetic using `DS`. |
| `GuideSessionController.swift` | ~1870 | Owns the install guide the reader is following: which guide and branch, the current step, completion, and what the step's primary action is (copy a command, open a link, run tool checks, or move on). Maps every `GuideService` failure to its own user-facing sentence, persists progress through `GuideService`'s existing key scheme, and refuses a step link whose host `ExternalLinkPolicy` does not allow rather than rendering a button that does nothing. Also owns the setup recovery detour (see below). |
| `GuidePanelView.swift` | ~837 | SwiftUI guide surface: step card, progress bar, command block with a Copy button and a transient confirmation, tool-check rows, the device-pair picker, the unsupported-pair explanation, the setup recovery card, the watch indicator with its pause toggle, the proactive `userStuck` hint banner, and the completion card. Also `GuideSlugEntryView`, the way into a guide when no `iris://` link was clicked. |
| `AppInventoryService.swift` | ~623 | Which publik catalog apps are on this Mac. Fetches the catalog from `/api/iris/apps`, resolves each `macBundleId` through `NSWorkspace` with an `mdfind` fallback, reads `CFBundleShortVersionString` out of the bundle, and compares it to the latest release tag. An app with no bundle identifier is `unknown`, never `notInstalled`. Also the two collaborator protocols (catalog source, installed-app locator) that make all of it testable without a network or a real installation. |
| `ReleaseVersionComparison.swift` | ~256 | Whether one release version is newer than another, done numerically rather than as a string compare, because `v1.10.0` sorts *before* `v1.9.0` alphabetically and offering that as an update is a downgrade. Handles a leading `v`, differing component counts, build metadata, and semver pre-release precedence; anything unparseable is `cannotBeCompared` rather than a guessed direction. |
| `AppInventorySectionView.swift` | ~520 | The "Your publik apps" section of the panel (installed apps only, anything with an update first, an "Update to …" button that opens the app's publik page through `ExternalLinkPolicy`) and the "Discover apps" section beneath it: a search over the live catalog where every app publik serves a guide for carries an "Install with Iris" pill that opens the guide at the eye. Iris never downloads binaries itself — the download route is auth-gated in the browser deliberately. |
| `WatchLoop.swift` | ~1030 | The adaptive watch loop (see above): the cheapest-first ladder, the model budget, the privacy gates, the dHash, the `userStuck` hint, the excluded-apps list, and the global pause. Also the four collaborator protocols it is built out of, so all of it is testable without a screen, a clock, a process, or a network. |
| `WatchLoopSystemSources.swift` | ~500 | The real macOS answers to those four protocols: a monotonic clock, ScreenCaptureKit for both the ~256 px fingerprint and the one visual frame, the local signals (AppKit, accessibility, `ToolVersionService`, `GitInspectionService`, secure input via the session dictionary), and the one model call, made through `AssistantTransport` and nothing else. |
| `OverlayWindow.swift` | ~1560 | Full-screen transparent overlay hosting the eye companion. Handles cursor following, where the eye is looking, element pointing with bezier arcs, multi-monitor coordinate mapping, and fade-out transitions. Owns the assistant-state → eye-mood mapping, and `OverlayWindowMouseEventGate` — the only thing allowed to turn the overlay's click-through off, and only for the eye. `OverlayWindowManager` builds one overlay per display AND keeps them on the displays that exist: it observes `didChangeScreenParametersNotification` and runs a 2s audit, both feeding `ScreenLayoutCompliance`, and rebuilds or re-frames the overlays when the verdict says so. |
| `ScreenLayoutCompliance.swift` | ~140 | The pure decision behind that: given the screen frames the overlays were built for, the screens connected now, and where the overlay windows actually are — nothing / put a moved window back / rebuild for the new display set / no screen at all. Exists because of the Sep 2 2026 incident: an overlay built for an unplugged 3440x1440 monitor was left covering the built-in display with its top edge 458pt above it, and the eye drawn off-screen ("I can't see Iris… it's out of bounds"). No screen-change observer existed anywhere in the app before this. `MenuBarPanelManager` and `GuideAutopilotTakeoverController` re-clamp on the same notification. Covered by `ScreenLayoutComplianceTests.swift`, which replays the incident's real numbers. |
| `OverlayEyeInteraction.swift` | ~607 | The eye as a *control*, with no AppKit or SwiftUI in it so all of it is testable without a screen: `OverlayEyeInteractionGeometry` (the 64pt eye, its resting place, the one rectangle that may accept a click, where the input bar hangs, how tall it may grow, and `rectOccupiedByIris` for the eye-plus-bar region), `OverlayEyeActivation` (eye → bar → gear → settings), `OverlayEyeExchange` (the bar's four-state conversation and the rule for who holds the keyboard), and `OverlayEyeSuggestions` — the suggestion chip strings, the working-state lines, and the Door-B edit chips + `editInstructionKind` classifier, in one place, guide-aware. |
| `OverlayEyeInputBarDropTarget.swift` | ~200 | The drag-and-drop half of the bar: `OverlayEyeInputBarClickOutsideDismissal`, the pure release-time rule for "a click outside dismisses" that keeps the bar standing when the press was the start of a drag (drag entered the bar, or the drag pasteboard moved), and `OverlayEyeBarDropDelegate`, the SwiftUI `DropDelegate` that turns a drop (image data or a file URL) into attachments and lights the "drop to attach" state. The header records the CGEvent measurement behind the design. |
| `OverlayEyeInputBarDraftStore.swift` | ~95 | The reader's UNSENT composer draft (text + fix/feature choice), kept in memory — one per `CompanionManager` — so a dismissal no longer throws away a half-typed request. The bar seeds its field from `draftToRestoreIntoAFreshBar` on open and mirrors it in via `remember(_:)` on change; sending clears the field and so clears the store. Deliberately never disk-backed (an unsent draft is not a conversation the reader chose to keep). |
| `IrisOverlayModalAlert.swift` | ~50 | One place to lift an `NSAlert` above Iris's full-screen `.screenSaver` eye overlay and make it key (`liftAboveTheEyeOverlay`), so a modal the app raises is visible and answerable instead of opening behind the overlay and freezing the Mac. All three `CompanionManager` consent alerts route through it; the certificate-signing alert forgetting it was the "certifying the fix froze my Mac" report. |
| `EditTerminalStartMinimizedPreference.swift` | ~55 | The persisted opt-in behind the "Edit terminal → Start minimized" setting (`UserDefaults`, `nonisolated`, mirrors `AutopilotAutonomyGrant`). When on, `reactToOnDemandEditPhase(.running)` skips the centered takeover so an on-demand edit starts minimized (the running card's "Show terminal" button reopens it). Scoped to edits, not guides (guides park on manual steps and keep a terminal inline). |
| `SelectionTextField.swift` | ~470 | Images into the bar: the cmd-V interception (a zero-size view claiming the key equivalent before the field editor), `OverlayEyePastedImageReader` (pasteboard, drag pasteboard, and file readers; bounded to 1280px / 1.5MB PNG-else-JPEG), and `OverlayEyePastedImageAttachment`, the bounded list (four) of images riding the next message, taken — not read — by the send path. |
| `OverlayEyeInputBarPanelManager.swift` | ~120 | The thumbnail row above the field: one thumbnail with its own × per attached image, and the caption saying the screen goes too. `EmptyView` when nothing is attached. |
| `OverlayEyeInputBar.swift` | ~2360 | Eye conversation and context-aware app composer in its own nonactivating panel. Unified shell, dedicated History view, confirmed New chat with unsent work, contextual task actions and pending-request presentation. Navigation preserves drafts and does not change overlay click-through. |
| `OverlayIrisEyeView.swift` | ~730 | The on-screen eye, transcribed from the website (`components/iris/IrisEye.tsx` plus the `.iris-eye*` rules in `app/globals.css`): track, shell, blinking lid, striated iris, pupil and glint. Also `IrisEyePupilGeometry`, the pure maths for where the iris sits — AppKit screen coordinates in, SwiftUI offsets out, one y flip, clamped so the pupil never leaves the lid — and `IrisEyeGazeTracker`, which decides whether to watch the pointer or fall back to the idle wander. Also `OverlaySettingsGearView`, the gear the eye becomes while the input bar is open — same diameter, same shell, same shadow, so the swap reads as one object changing what it offers. Distinct from `IrisEyeView.swift`, which is the smaller panel-header eye from the Tauri shell. |
| `CompanionResponseOverlay.swift` | ~217 | SwiftUI view for a cursor-following response text bubble. Currently unused by the pipeline (responses render in the panel) but kept compiling. |
| `CompanionScreenCaptureUtility.swift` | ~132 | Multi-monitor screenshot capture using ScreenCaptureKit. Returns labeled image data for each connected display. |
| `GlobalSummonHotkeyMonitor.swift` | ~167 | System-wide summon hotkey monitor (ctrl + option). Owns the listen-only `CGEvent` tap and publishes press/release transitions; a press toggles the companion panel. |
| `ClaudeAPI.swift` | ~360 | Claude vision API client with streaming (SSE) and non-streaming modes. Transport-driven: asks `AssistantTransport` for the URL and headers on every request, omits `model` on the funded route, maps non-2xx responses to `AssistantTransportError`. Per-host TLS warmup, image MIME detection, conversation history support. |
| `AssistantTransport.swift` | ~410 | Chooses between the funded and the two BYO routes (pasted key, or Claude Code OAuth token) and builds the request for each. The only place credentials are attached, and the enforcement point for "no BYO credential ever reaches a publik host". Also owns the funded tier's error-code → user-visible-state mapping. |
| `ClaudeCodeLogin.swift` | ~360 | "CLI login": connect the reader's Claude Code login as the BYO Anthropic credential instead of pasting a key. Two ways in — `ClaudeCodeSetupTokenSession` runs `claude setup-token` in a pty and scrapes the long-lived `sk-ant-oat…` token; `importFromExistingClaudeLogin` reads the token an existing `claude login` stored in the "Claude Code-credentials" Keychain item. Both land it in `.anthropicOAuthToken`. Also `AnthropicBringYourOwnCredential`, the single key-or-token resolver. The interactive capture + live OAuth header are UNVERIFIED until exercised on a real Mac; the pure pieces (token scan, blob parse, redaction) are tested. |
| `CodexCLILogin.swift` | ~465 | "Sign in with Codex": connect the reader's ChatGPT account through their `codex` CLI. Stores NOTHING — no Keychain kind — because the CLI owns the token and its refresh; Iris reads `~/.codex/auth.json` (honoring `CODEX_HOME`) only for shape, never for material. `CodexCLISignInSession` runs `codex login` in a pty; success is detected by the credential landing on disk, NOT by matching the CLI's success wording, because wording is not a contract. `disconnect()` shells `codex logout` rather than deleting another program's file. |
| `CodexMaintainProvider.swift` | ~470 | The Codex Tier C provider, over `codex exec` (prompt on stdin, `--json` events, `--output-last-message`). `CodexExecInvocation` builds and re-validates the argument vector — read-only sandbox, ephemeral, ignore-user-config, no `--dangerously-*` — and serializes systemPrompt + conversation into the one prompt Codex takes, behind a framing preamble that stops the agent wandering off to do the task with its own shell. `CodexExecOutput` parses the event stream and maps failures onto the loop's existing vocabulary (a rate limit becomes `AssistantTransportError.rateLimited`, so the existing backoff just works). `maximumOutputTokens` is genuinely NOT honored — `codex exec` has no output cap — and says so. |
| `AccountService.swift` | ~797 | Supabase auth with no SDK: PKCE OAuth in the system browser (`ASWebAuthenticationSession`), email+password, and refresh-token rotation. Publishes signed-in state; owns the user's BYO key, validated on entry with a `count_tokens` call. Reuses `DeepLinkParser` for the `iris://auth/callback` case. |
| `KeychainStore.swift` | ~160 | The only code that touches the Keychain. Stores a small fixed set of secrets under service `com.publikhq.iris`: the BYO Anthropic key, the Claude Code OAuth token, the OpenAI key, the Supabase refresh token, and the GitHub token pair. Never logs any. (Claude Code's OWN login lives under a different service, `Claude Code-credentials`, read only by `ClaudeCodeLogin`'s import.) |
| `ElementLocationDetector.swift` | ~335 | Detects UI element locations in screenshots for cursor pointing. |
| `DesignSystem.swift` | ~700 | Native pearl/slate panel tokens, compact control styles and unified-panel environment. Fixed eye colors are separate from adaptive panel colors to preserve the existing eye. |
| `IrisChatLoadingBar.swift` | ~81 | Stateless indeterminate blue activity line with bounded redraw schedule and static Reduce Motion fallback. Mount only for an actual pending request; no percentage or simulated completion. Preview contains no app/account state. |
| `IrisEyeView.swift` | ~140 | The animated Iris eye from `.iris-eye`: blinking lid, pointer-following iris, mood satellite (green while watching/done, ring tint while thinking, slit while paused), and an optional progress ring used while a guide is open. Shown in the panel header; the menu bar icon is its static twin. |
| `WindowPositionManager.swift` | ~312 | Window placement logic, Screen Recording permission flow, and accessibility permission helpers. Also `launchNewInstance(ofApplicationAt:)` — the target-bundle-keyed "start a fresh instance" primitive (`relaunchToApplyPermissions` is its self-relaunch special case) that `AppRelaunchService` launches an edited clone build through. |
| `OnDemandEditCoordinator.swift` | ~3800 | The user-initiated on-demand edit phase machine (pick → describe → clarify/plan → consent → run → preview keep/discard → deliver-over-installed → relaunch → done), all safety rails live-checked; injected seams for the request probe, the engine call, fork backup, packaging, over-install delivery (`deliverEditedAppOverInstalledApp` / `restoreInstalledAppFromBackup`), relaunch, and public publish. A FEATURE run injects `featureVisibilityGuidance` so the requested behavior is visible by default, never buried behind an unrequested off-by-default toggle (founder, Sep 2 2026). The describe step runs `FeatureEditRequestProbe` off-path (published `isAssessingRequest`, generation-guarded, 20s fail-open watchdog) so the two model-derived §7 triggers are live. A mid-run credential rejection maps to a settings-offering failure (`mappedFailure`, now static + unit-tested). The up-front scope refusal and the Tier C step budget were removed by founder decision (Aug 20 2026) — the loop runs until DONE or a genuine stall, under a distant runaway backstop, with the sent conversation windowed on long runs. Since Aug 21 2026 it also streams the engine's live progress (`presentEngineProgress`) into the terminal + status line and owns the reader-stop latch (`stopRunningEdit` / `readerAskedToStopTheRun`), presenting a stop as a calm "nothing was changed" ending. |
| `FeatureEditRequestProbe.swift` | ~270 | The two MODEL-derived §7 clarification triggers, previously hardcoded `false`: self-consistency ambiguity (two independent reasoning passes + a one-word agreement judge — at most 3 small calls on the reader's own key) and the irreversible-action classifier. Pure prompts/parsers + a fail-open `probe(...)`: any miss yields the all-quiet verdict, so the probe can only ever ADD a question, never a refusal or a block. |
| `OnDemandEditRunner.swift` | ~150 | The "watch it work" adapter: renders the coordinator's prose AND the engine's live activity (real jailed commands, output tails, exit codes — never a fabricated row) into the guide autopilot's terminal transcript without faking a guide. Defines `AutopilotTerminalPresenting`, the protocol both it and `GuideAutopilotRunner` satisfy so the terminal view + takeover are generic. |
| `OnDemandEditCard.swift` | ~560 | The phase-driven SwiftUI card in the eye bar (describe with explicit fix/feature pick → consents → live-status running card with a Stop button → committed-diff preview → honest result → fork/publish), driven by `OnDemandEditCoordinator`, not the maintain ask. A feature reads "applied and rebuilt", never "verified". |
| `MaintainDiagnosticProbe.swift` | ~390 | The "interrogate the machine first" prompt section (codesign/spctl/plutil/defaults/lipo/otool/sqlite3/launchctl/lsof/pgrep — measured to actually run inside the jail; `log show`/`ps`/`sample`/`sfltool` do not, and the prompt says so) + the pure read-only-probe classifier that keeps an investigating step from counting as a stall. |
| `MaintainManifestApplier.swift` | ~1030 | The G3 manifest channel: `MaintainManifestChangeRequest` (addCargoDependency / addNodeDependency / addInfoPlistKey / addEntitlement), the strict ```manifest parser, whitelisted inert appliers (never scripts/hooks/`build =`; post-condition re-parse proves only the one entry changed), `applyToRepo` with symlink/escape refusal, and `modelFacingProtocolPromptAddendum`. The model declares; Iris applies after consent. |
| `IrisLocalSigningIdentity.swift` | ~890 | A STABLE code-signing identity for rebuilt apps: the user's Developer ID when present, else a persistent self-signed "Iris Local Code Signing" cert created once with consent; inside-out bundle signing; packaging-metadata verification (`verifyPackagedMetadata`). Live certificate creation/signing UNVERIFIED on a real Mac; pure parsing tested. |
| `OnDemandEditAppEvidence.swift` | ~220 | Runtime evidence for an edit run: the picked app's frontmost-window screenshot (ScreenCaptureKit) + scrubbed unified-log tail and newest crash-report excerpt. Best-effort — nil on any miss; BYO route only. |
| `MaintainFileEditApplier.swift` | ~230 | The structured file-editing tool: parse ```write / ```edit blocks and apply them as Iris's own atomic, path-confined, build-file-refusing writes — so the model never sed-surgeries a file through the jailed shell again. |
| `OnDemandEditInterruptedRunRecovery.swift` | ~230 | The on-disk record of an edit run's uncommitted footprint (clone, base commit, paths the engine edited, what it was waiting on) and the synchronous recovery run at launch and at quit: reverts exactly those paths, only if HEAD is still the base and nothing else is dirty; otherwise leaves the tree and keeps the record so the dirty-clone card can name Iris's files. Written for the Sep 3 2026 WhimprFlow orphan. |
| `OnDemandEditPullRequestOpener.swift` | ~200 | Opens the pull request for a kept edit — never a merge — through the connected GitHub App or, when that is dormant, the reader's own signed-in `gh` (push with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, then `gh pr create` with the body in a file); reports opened / already open / pushed-but-no-PR / not set up / failed, and reads the viewer's permission from `gh` to decide whether Iris's own re-check may open one. |
| `OnDemandEditRunLog.swift` | ~510 | The per-run plain-text transcript under `~/Library/Logs/Iris/edit-runs/` (request, narration, commands, exits, outcome — what the terminal displayed, persisted). Distinct from `irisTrace`'s structure-only iris.log; pruned to the newest 20 runs; a nil init never affects the run. |
| `AppRelaunchService.swift` | ~900 | Rebuild → deliver → relaunch: package a fresh launchable artifact FROM the clone (`cargo tauri build` / the repo's electron packaging script), assert it exists BEFORE terminating the old process, then (founder override, Sep 2 2026) `installFreshBuildOverInstalledApp` REPLACES the reader's installed copy in place — snapshot for undo, `ditto`-stage beside it, atomic `replaceItemAt` swap, `restoreInstalledAppFromBackup` for undo; falls back to launching the build-dir artifact when no separate installed copy exists or the swap fails. Graceful-quit then force-quit only on explicit consent. Filesystem swap UNVERIFIED until run on a real machine; the pure copy-selection logic (`chooseInstalledBundlePath`) is tested. |
| `MaintainClonePathLock.swift` | ~77 | A per-clonePath, main-actor mutex so the crash-incident path and the on-demand editor never strip `.git`/revert the same tree at once. Canonicalizes via symlink resolution so a raw and a resolved path map to one latch. |
| `MaintainBuildScriptGuard.swift` | ~75 | Pure detection of build-script files (`build.rs`, `package.json`, `Makefile`, `*.podspec`, …) a build step executes — the coordinator blocks a model edit to one BEFORE the un-jailed verification build runs it. |
| `MaintainFixCommit.swift` | ~86 | The one place a verified tree becomes a commit on a fresh branch: branch naming + commit script + structured trailer block (no `Co-Authored-By`), parameterized by change id and trailer vocabulary. Shared by `RecipeReplayEngine`, the crash path, and on-demand. |
| `AppBundleConfiguration.swift` | ~28 | Runtime configuration reader for keys stored in the app bundle Info.plist. |
| `worker/src/index.ts` | ~142 | Cloudflare Worker proxy, kept as a wire-format reference. Only `/chat` (Claude) is used by the app. |
| `DeliveredEditUndoRecovery.swift` | ~51 | In-memory Undo checkpoints and the checked source-restore command. Retry skips completed stages; failures retain recovery information. Dirty or moved source is refused, and the edit branch is retained. Isolated driver and disposable Git fixtures do not establish native app-restoration or restart recovery. |
| `DeliveredEditUndoRecoveryStore.swift` | ~105 | Saves minimal metadata before Undo, refuses overwrite and exposes interrupted/corrupt records for review. Uncertain bundle swaps are never automatically replayed. |
| `DeliveredEditUndoArchive.swift` | ~149 | Stop Undo archives exact bounded record bytes before clearing the active marker. Valid archives protect affected slugs and overlapping app/clone/backup paths; unrelated targets remain usable. Unknown targets fail closed. Stop never restores an app or moves a backup. |
| `SavedUndoRecoverySection.swift` | ~37 | Persistent read-only access to stopped-Undo records in General settings. Does not delete archives or mark recovery complete. |
| `PatchQueueCheckedRemoval.swift` | ~51 | Checked, exact-record queue removal for Undo. Verifies identity and absence, refuses conflicting paths, and preserves a visible failure for retry. Other queue callers retain their existing semantics. |

## Build & Run

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open leanring-buddy.xcodeproj

# Select the leanring-buddy scheme, set signing team, Cmd+R to build and run

# Known non-blocking warnings: Swift 6 concurrency warnings,
# deprecated onChange warning in OverlayWindow.swift. Do NOT attempt to fix these.
```

**Do NOT run `xcodebuild` from the terminal** — it invalidates TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions and the app will need to re-request screen recording, accessibility, etc.

## Cloudflare Worker (dead — reference only)

The app no longer calls this. It is inherited from the upstream Clicky fork and kept as a wire-format reference; the commands below are historical.

```bash
cd worker
npm install

# Add secrets (only ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is used by the app;
# the upstream worker also documents ASSEMBLYAI/ELEVENLABS routes that Iris no longer calls)
npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Deploy
npx wrangler deploy

# Local dev (create worker/.dev.vars with your keys)
npx wrangler dev
```

## Code Style & Conventions

### Variable and Method Naming

IMPORTANT: Follow these naming rules strictly. Clarity is the top priority.

- Be as clear and specific with variable and method names as possible
- **Optimize for clarity over concision.** A developer with zero context on the codebase should immediately understand what a variable or method does just from reading its name
- Use longer names when it improves clarity. Do NOT use single-character variable names
- Example: use `originalQuestionLastAnsweredDate` instead of `originalAnswered`
- When passing props or arguments to functions, keep the same names as the original variable. Do not shorten or abbreviate parameter names. If you have `currentCardData`, pass it as `currentCardData`, not `card` or `cardData`

### Code Clarity

- **Clear is better than clever.** Do not write functionality in fewer lines if it makes the code harder to understand
- Write more lines of code if additional lines improve readability and comprehension
- Make things so clear that someone with zero context would completely understand the variable names, method names, what things do, and why they exist
- When a variable or method name alone cannot fully explain something, add a comment explaining what is happening and why

### Swift/SwiftUI Conventions

- Use SwiftUI for all UI unless a feature is only supported in AppKit (e.g., `NSPanel` for floating windows)
- All UI state updates must be on `@MainActor`
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Comments should explain "why" not just "what", especially for non-obvious AppKit bridging
- AppKit `NSPanel`/`NSWindow` bridged into SwiftUI via `NSHostingView`
- All buttons must show a pointer cursor on hover
- For any interactive element, explicitly think through its hover behavior (cursor, visual feedback, and whether hover should communicate clickability)

### Do NOT

- Do not add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
- Do not add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you did not change
- Do not try to fix the known non-blocking warnings (Swift 6 concurrency, deprecated onChange)
- Do not rename the project directory or scheme (the "leanring" typo is intentional/legacy)
- Do not run `xcodebuild` from the terminal — it invalidates TCC permissions

## Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise, explain the "why" not the "what"
- Do not force-push to main

## Self-Update Instructions

<!-- AI agents: follow these instructions to keep this file accurate. -->

When you make changes to this project that affect the information in this file, update this file to reflect those changes. Specifically:

1. **New files**: Add new source files to the "Key Files" table with their purpose and approximate line count
2. **Deleted files**: Remove entries for files that no longer exist
3. **Architecture changes**: Update the architecture section if you introduce new patterns, frameworks, or significant structural changes
4. **Build changes**: Update build commands if the build process changes
5. **New conventions**: If the user establishes a new coding convention during a session, add it to the appropriate conventions section
6. **Line count drift**: If a file's line count changes significantly (>50 lines), update the approximate count in the Key Files table

Do NOT update this file for minor edits, bug fixes, or changes that don't affect the documented architecture or conventions.
