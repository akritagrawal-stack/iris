//  The compact "Your publik apps" section of the menu bar panel: which catalog
//  apps are on this Mac, which version each one is, and which of them has a
//  newer release waiting.
//
//  Only installed apps appear. An app publik has no bundle identifier for is
//  invisible here on purpose — `AppInventoryService` reports it as `unknown`,
//  and there is no honest row to draw for "I cannot tell". Listing every
//  catalog app with a state next to it would also be ten rows in a 320pt panel,
//  which is a wall rather than a section.
//
//  The update affordance opens the app's page on publik in the browser. It does
//  not download or install anything: the download route is auth-gated in the
//  browser deliberately, and the browser is where that gate lives.
