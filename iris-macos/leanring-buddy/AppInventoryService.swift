//  Knows which publik catalog apps are on this Mac, which version of each, and
//  which one the user is looking at right now.
//
//  The distinction this file exists to protect is the one between "this app is
//  not installed" and "I cannot tell whether this app is installed". The
//  catalog carries a `macBundleId` for only some listings and deliberately
//  leaves the rest null — see the comment on that field in
//  `lib/apps-config.ts`. A null is not permission to guess an identifier from
//  the product name: a wrong identifier never matches anything, so Iris would
//  quietly and confidently report a perfectly well installed app as missing.
//  Every app with no bundle identifier is therefore reported as `unknown`, and
//  the UI says nothing about it at all. Telling someone an app is missing when
//  you simply cannot see it is a lie, and it is the kind of lie that makes
//  someone reinstall something they already have.
//
//  Nothing here downloads or installs anything. The update affordance opens the
//  app's publik page in the browser through `ExternalLinkPolicy`, because the
//  download route is auth-gated in the browser on purpose.
