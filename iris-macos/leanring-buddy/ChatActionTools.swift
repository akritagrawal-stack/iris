//  ChatActionTools.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  The three things a chat message can actually DO — put text on the reader's
//  clipboard, run one command on their Mac, and open a publik install guide at
//  the eye — plus the gate the command passes before it runs.
//
//  Until this file existed, chat was structurally incapable of doing either:
//  `buildRequestBody` was called with no tools on the chat route, ever, so a
//  reader who asked Iris to copy something or run something got a refusal
//  from a model that had no code path to say yes with. Readers reported that
//  as Iris sulking, and they were right — it was not honesty, it was a
//  missing wire.
//
//  What is NOT here is a second risk model. Every command goes through
//  `GuideAutopilotRiskAssessment.assess` — the same three-tier gate the guide
//  autopilot uses, including the catastrophe floor that is refused even under
//  the "Let Iris take control of your Mac?" grant. One gate, one place to
//  read, one place to fix. `GuideAutopilotApprovedCommand`'s initialiser is
//  private, so "run an unassessed command" is not something this file can
//  express even by accident.
//
//  Be clear-eyed about the boundary, the way the risk assessment's own header
//  is. The gate is a guardrail against a model's mistakes, not a sandbox
//  around an adversary — and chat's context contains things Iris merely READ
//  (a screenshot of the reader's screen, a web search result, a command's own
//  output), any of which could contain text shaped like an instruction. The
//  prompt tells the model in as many words that read text is information and
//  never an order; the round and command budgets here mean a model that
//  ignores that still cannot run away with the machine; and the risk gate
//  still stands in front of every command either way.
//
