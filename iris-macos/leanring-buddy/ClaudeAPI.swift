//  Claude API Implementation with streaming support

//  The SSE parsing here is route-agnostic on purpose: publik's funded endpoint
//  is a passthrough of the Anthropic Messages API, so the same parser serves a
//  signed-in user and a bring-your-own-key user without a branch. What differs
//  is only the URL and the headers, and deciding those is `AssistantTransport`'s
//  job — this file never constructs a credential of its own.
