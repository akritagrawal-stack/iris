//
//  CodexMaintainProvider.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  The third Tier C provider: the reader's own ChatGPT account, reached by
//  driving the Codex CLI they already signed in to (see `CodexCLILogin.swift`
//  for why Iris drives the CLI instead of holding the credential).
//
//  The seam is `codex exec`, the CLI's documented non-interactive mode. It maps
//  onto `MaintainModelProviding` almost exactly:
//
//      MaintainModelProviding            codex exec
//      ─────────────────────             ──────────
//      systemPrompt + conversation  →    the prompt, on stdin
//      one assistant text turn out  ←    --output-last-message <file>
//      attachedImagePNGData         →    --image <file>
//      (accounting, for the harness) ←   --json event stream
//
//  FOUR FLAGS THAT ARE NOT OPTIONAL, and what each one is load-bearing for:
//
//    --sandbox read-only     Codex is an AGENT, not a raw model endpoint: it has
//                            a shell and will use it. Iris's fix loop does its
//                            own editing, verifying and committing, and a second
//                            agent writing to the same tree behind its back is
//                            precisely the class of bug the maintain harness was
//                            built to catch. Read-only is the wall.
//    --ephemeral             Every call must be stateless. The fix loop replays
//                            the whole windowed conversation each step and owns
//                            the history; a CLI-side session would silently make
//                            the model see a different past than the loop thinks
//                            it does.
//    --ignore-user-config    The reader's own ~/.codex/config.toml can pin a
//                            model, a provider, instructions, hooks, MCP servers.
//                            Iris's fix protocol is not something a stray local
//                            config gets to reshape.
//    --skip-git-repo-check   The scratch working directory is deliberately not a
//                            repo (see below); without this the CLI refuses.
//
//  These are enforced twice — built in one place, then re-checked by
//  `CodexExecInvocation.validated(_:)` before launch — for the same reason
//  `AssistantTransport.validatedRequest` exists: a later refactor that "helpfully"
//  makes the sandbox configurable trips an error instead of quietly handing a
//  second agent write access to the reader's disk.
