//
//  CompanionPanelView.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  The SwiftUI content hosted inside the menu bar panel: Iris's settings.
//  Permissions, the model picker, the guide, the installed publik apps, the
//  account rows and quit. Designed to feel like Loom's recording panel — dark,
//  rounded, minimal, and special.
//
//  THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU TALK TO IRIS. Asking a question and reading the answer
//  both happen in the bar under the eye (`OverlayEyeInputBar.swift`). This panel
//  used to carry a second copy of that conversation — its own "Ask Iris" field
//  and its own response area — which meant one exchange spread over two windows
//  and a bar at the eye that threw the reader in here the moment they used it.
//  The exchange belongs at the eye; the settings belong here; the gear beside
//  the bar is the way from one to the other.
