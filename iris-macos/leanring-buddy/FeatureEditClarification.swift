//
//  FeatureEditClarification.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  The follow-up / clarification protocol for the Feature Engine (plan §7).
//
//  The design goal is "asks the right follow-ups" WITHOUT dribbling: the
//  should-I-ask decision is decoupled from the edit loop entirely (OpenHands
//  measured a real resolve-rate gain from that split), the questions are
//  batched into ONE round before any edit (Plan-Mode shape), and a question is
//  emitted ONLY when one of five fixed triggers fires — otherwise the engine
//  proceeds. This file is that decision, pure: no model calls, no file I/O,
//  no SwiftUI. The coordinator gathers the boolean/shape signals (from the
//  derived RepoRecipe, from the two-pass self-consistency check, from the
//  request classifier) and this logic turns them into the compact, tappable
//  question set the eye-bar card presents — a couple of decisive questions,
//  never a chat interrogation.
//

/// editing (plan §7). Keeping the triggers as a closed enum — rather than

/// "few, high-value" rule structurally: a new kind of question requires a new
/// case here, which forces the over-asking conversation to happen in review.
