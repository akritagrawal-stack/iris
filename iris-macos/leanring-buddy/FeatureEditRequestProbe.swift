//
//  The two MODEL-DERIVED clarification triggers from plan §7, previously
//  passed as a hardcoded `false` from the describe step:
//
//    1. ambiguity — "the request could be built in ≥2 materially different
//       ways and nothing in the repo disambiguates", adjudicated by
//       SELF-CONSISTENCY: two quick, independent reasoning passes each state
//       the implementation they would choose; a third tiny call judges whether
//       the two statements are materially the same. Disagreement = ambiguous.
//    2. irreversibility — each pass also classifies whether the request
//       implies a hard-to-undo action (a data/save-file format change, a
//       public interface break, a destructive migration). Either pass flagging
//       it is enough: a false positive costs one question, a false negative
//       costs an unconsented destructive change.
//
//  A missing provider, a thrown model call, or an unparseable reply never
//  blocks an edit. Instead, the verdict records that the optional safety
//  classification was unavailable so the deterministic clarification layer
//  can ask one bounded, plain-language question. The prompts and parsers are
//  pure and unit-tested; only `probe(...)` touches a provider.
