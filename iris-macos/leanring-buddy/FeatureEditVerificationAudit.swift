//
//  The anti-gaming + mutation layer of the Feature Engine's verification ladder
//  (plan §9). Iris is both prosecutor and defendant — it authors the change AND
//  the test that "proves" it — so a green suite is necessary but never
//  sufficient. This file holds the pure, static checks that make "the maker
//  must not grade its own homework" real:
//
//    1. `cheatSignatures(inUnifiedDiff:)` — scans the applied diff for the
//       tamper patterns a self-verifying agent reaches for when it wants a
//       green light without earning it: tautological asserts, catch/except
//       blocks that swallow, newly focused/skipped tests, re-recorded
//       snapshots, a test that mocks the very module it is supposed to
//       exercise, and a net DROP in test/assertion count. This generalizes the
//       existing `VerificationHarness.enforceDiffScope` "weakens tests" check
//       from a line-count heuristic to named cheat signatures.
//
//    2. `mutationCommand(forEcosystem:changedFiles:)` — picks the right mutation
//       tester (Stryker / PIT / cargo-mutants / mutmut) scoped to the changed
//       source files, so an agent-authored test must PROVE it is sensitive
//       (kills injected mutants) before it is trusted — the antidote to a test
//       that runs green while verifying nothing (ratified decision 4b).
//
//    3. `cleanCloneVerifyPlan(repoRootPath:branch:)` — the git commands that
//       stand up a pristine, throwaway checkout of the committed branch OUTSIDE
//       the maker's dirty working tree, so the verification pass runs as a
//       separate CHECKER that cannot see (or be fooled by) the maker's
//       in-progress state.
//
//  Everything here is pure Foundation: static string/diff analysis and command
//  STRING building only. It never spawns a process, never touches the network,
//  never executes anything from the target repo — the commands it composes are
//  handed to the (classifier-screened, staged-consent) shell runner elsewhere,
//  exactly as the recipe commands are.
//
