//
//  THE FIX LADDER, FOR A READER WHOSE ONLY CREDENTIAL IS THE CODEX CLI.
//
//  Reported by a tester who watched an install stop with "I've used up what I
//  can spend on this install for now", and answered: "I have the codex CLI? The
//  usage shouldn't be a problem."
//
//  He was right, and the cap was made provider-aware — but that only got him
//  half a fix, because the thing the cap was gating could not run on his
//  credential at all. `GuideAutopilotFixProposer` gets its fix by FORCING a tool
//  call (`toolChoice: ["type": "tool", "name": "propose_fix"]`) over the
//  Anthropic Messages API, so the model must answer with a `tool_use` block
//  matching a strict schema. `codex exec` is a CLI: it returns text and an
//  `--output-last-message` file, and has no tool-use wire format to force. So a
//  codex-only reader had no ladder, and nothing for the funded tier to fall back
//  to when publik's budget ran out.
//
//  The way out is the one this codebase already uses everywhere else it needs
//  structure out of Codex: Tier C gets executable actions from the same text-only
//  CLI by asking for FENCED BLOCKS and parsing them (```bash, ```write, ```edit).
//  Same trick. Ask for one fenced JSON object with the same fields the tool
//  schema demands, parse it, and hand it to the SAME validator the Anthropic
//  route uses.
//
//  That last point is the load-bearing one. `validatedFix(fromProposalObject:)`
//  is not a decoder — it carries the guardrail that refuses a fix reaching any
//  host the guide's own commands do not already name, which is the structural
//  answer to a model inventing a plausible hostname. Writing a second parser
//  here is exactly how one route quietly loses a guardrail the other keeps, so
//  this file does not parse a fix at all: it finds a JSON object and delegates.
//
//  HONEST DIFFERENCES from the Anthropic route, neither of them papered over:
//
//    - BOTH RUNGS SEARCH. `CodexExecInvocation` sets `-c tools.web_search=true`
//      unconditionally, so there is no material-only rung here the way there is
//      on the Anthropic side. `cameFromWebSearch` therefore reports what the run
//      could have done, not proof it did.
//    - IT IS SLOWER. Measured at roughly 9x the Anthropic route per step. On a
//      ladder that is at most two rungs per step this is a pause, not a stall,
//      and it beats the alternative of the install simply stopping.

    THIS TURN OVERRIDES THE BLOCK FORMAT DESCRIBED ABOVE. `CodexMaintainProvider` \
    prepends a preamble written for Iris's app-editing loop, which tells you to \
    reach the repository by emitting command and edit blocks. That does not apply \
    here: you are proposing ONE fix for Iris to run, not performing the work. \
    Emit no command block, no edit block, and no write block.

    Reply with EXACTLY ONE fenced json block and nothing else — no prose before \
    it, no explanation after it. There is no propose_fix tool on this route; the \
    json block IS the proposal.

    ```json
    {
      "diagnosis": "one sentence on why the command failed",
      "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
      "retryTheOriginalCommandAfterwards": true | false,
      "action": { ... one of the three below ... }
    }
    ```

    The action is exactly one of:

      {"kind": "runACommand", "command": "…", "whatItDoes": "plain English, one line"}
      {"kind": "askTheReaderToDoSomething", "instruction": "…"}
      {"kind": "cannotFixThis", "reason": "…"}

    Do not run anything yourself, do not edit any file, and do not use your own \
    shell to investigate. You are being asked for ONE proposal as json; Iris runs \
    it, under its own safety gate.
