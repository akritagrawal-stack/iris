//
//  GuideAutopilotShellSession.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  One persistent login shell for one guide session. Steps in a guide assume
//  their predecessors' state — `cd cue` then `npm ci` — so commands run in a
//  single long-lived shell, not one process per command, and the session
//  remembers its cwd from the end marker of every command.
//
//  The environment is built from scratch, never inherited: a Finder-launched
//  app carries launchd's four-directory PATH, and handing that to the shell
//  is how "Iris says node is missing but it is right there" happens. PATH is
//  deliberately absent from the child environment so the login+interactive
//  shell rebuilds it through path_helper and the user's own dotfiles.
//
//  The shell is driven through a generated ZDOTDIR whose .zshrc loads the
//  user's real zsh setup and then turns off ZLE, zsh's interactive line
//  editor. That is what makes programmatic command injection reliable: with
//  ZLE off there is no per-keystroke echo, no bracketed paste, and no prompt
//  redraw to mangle or wedge the input, and — because it happens during
//  shell startup, before a byte of injected input is read — there is no race.
//  See `privateZdotdir`.
//
//  Exit codes ride an in-band sentinel: after each command the session sends
//      printf '\n__IRIS_END_<token>__ %d\t%s\n' "$?" "$PWD"
//  with a fresh random token per command, matched only at line start — so a
//  file that happens to contain the marker text cannot forge completion.
//  Fields are tab-separated because a cwd with spaces is ordinary.
//
//  Isolation: the sentinel path is confined to the pty's own queue, never
//  the main actor. A running install must complete its bookkeeping even
//  while the app's main thread is busy drawing, or blocked by something
//  unrelated — if marker detection rode the main actor, a stalled UI would
//  read as a stalled shell. Only the public API surface and the output-line
//  callback touch the main actor.
