//
//  The centered "takeover" the autopilot runs its install in. When the reader
//  taps "Let Iris run it", the eye flies to the middle of the screen and the
//  install stops being a small pane tucked under the guide card in the corner:
//  a dim backdrop drops over the desktop and the eye MORPHS into a real macOS
//  Terminal window at the center — growing out of the eye's spot while the eye
//  fades and shrinks into it — runs the whole install there, then folds back
//  into the eye when it is done. It is the Swift port of the Windows renderer's
//  eye→terminal→eye morph (iris-windows/src/renderer/autopilot), which is the
//  agreed spec.
//
//  Why its own windows, not the overlay: the full-screen eye overlay is
//  click-through everywhere except the eye's own gate (see OverlayWindow), so it
//  cannot host the terminal's Run-it / Your-turn buttons. This mirrors the input
//  bar's pattern instead — a small non-activating panel that DOES take clicks —
//  with a second, click-through backdrop panel behind it for the dim. The
//  terminal content is GuideAutopilotTerminalView verbatim; only where it is
//  shown changes.

/// and SwiftUI backs every selectable `Text` with an `NSTextField`/`NSTextView`

/// (400x340: a 24pt title strip, the transcript, the manual-step bar), posting
/// real `CGEvent` drags of (-150, +60) and reading the window frame back:

///     transcript, middle       SelectionTextField         DID NOT MOVE
///     transcript, left gutter  SelectionTextField         DID NOT MOVE

/// The reader's words were "the terminal Iris is using is not movable at all"
/// and "please make the terminal movable" — a strip they will never find does
/// not answer that.
///
/// HOW IT WORKS. The press is HELD rather than dispatched, and what the reader
/// does next decides who gets it:
///
///   - the pointer travels past `theSlopAClickIsAllowed` → this window owns the
///     rest of the gesture and moves itself, one `setFrameOrigin` per dragged

///   - the button comes back up first → it was a CLICK, not a drag. The
///     mouse-up is pushed back to the front of the queue and the held mouse-down
///     is re-sent, so the view underneath sees an untouched click and behaves
///     exactly as it did before: buttons fire, and a double- or triple-click
///     still selects a word or a line in the transcript.
///
/// WHAT THIS COSTS, stated plainly: click-and-DRAG to select a range of
/// transcript text now moves the window instead of selecting. That is a real
/// trade and it is deliberate — the reported bug is a window the reader cannot
/// get off the download button they are being told to click, and every other
/// way of copying output survives (double-click a word, triple-click a line,
/// right-click → Copy, and the wheel still scrolls because only
