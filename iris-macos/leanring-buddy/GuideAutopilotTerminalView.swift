//
//  GuideAutopilotTerminalView.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  The terminal Iris runs the install in, shown under the guide card while
//  autopilot is on. It renders `GuideAutopilotRunner`'s transcript — a list of
//  pure values — and, when a risky command is waiting, the confirm row.
//
//  It is dressed as a real macOS Terminal window on purpose: a title bar with
//  the three traffic lights, a solid dark body, a `%` prompt in front of every
//  command, and a block cursor that blinks while a command is actually running.
//  Iris can finish an install in a blink; a reader watching a blank flash does
//  not believe anything happened. So each command is typed out and its result
//  is held on screen for a moment (`GuideAutopilotPacing`) — the shell is never
//  slowed, only the way it is shown. A complex install then reads as a sequence
//  of deliberate steps rather than an instant that is hard to trust.
//
//  Three signals still set a fix apart from a guide command at a glance: an
//  amber prompt and rule (guide commands get the accent), a small "Iris's fix"
//  label above it, and an indent. Iris's own sentences render in the prose
//  font, never monospace, so the reader can always tell Iris from the machine.
