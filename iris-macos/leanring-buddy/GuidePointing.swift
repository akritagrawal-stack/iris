//  Where the eye goes while a guide step is open.
//
//  A guide that only prints commands is worth no more than the web page it
//  duplicates. What the desktop can do that a web page cannot is *show you the
//  thing* — fly to the button and hold there until you have clicked it.
//
//  Everything here is pure: it decides what to look for and turns a found
//  rectangle into a place to point. Finding it is `GuidePointingResolver`'s
//  job, and the accessibility and model work behind that lives in
//  `WatchLoopSystemSources.swift`, which already has both.
