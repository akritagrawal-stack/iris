//  Owns one in-progress install guide: which guide is open, which branch of it
//  the reader picked, how far into that branch they are, and what the panel
//  should offer them to press next.
//
//  This is the state layer the Tauri panel keeps in its `state` object
//  (`iris-desktop/ui/app.js` — `loadGuide`, `setPlatform`, `moveStep`,
//  `updatePrimaryAction`, `verifyCurrentTools`), which remains the behavioral
//  spec. Nothing here re-implements validation: fetching, version checking,
//  handoff resolution, and progress storage all go through `GuideService`, link
//  policy goes through `ExternalLinkPolicy`, and tool checks go through
//  `ToolVersionService`.
