/// (`wordsThatStartSayingWhereItIs`) and the halves are used for different

///     header link "Download" for none, so the row wins however early in the

///  2. `balance` — the harmonic mean of that coverage and how much of the LABEL
///     is name, which breaks ties toward a label that is the name and nothing
///     else ("Run" over "Run Destination" for "the Run button").
