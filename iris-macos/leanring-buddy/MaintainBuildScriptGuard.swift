//  MaintainBuildScriptGuard.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  Pure detection of build-script files in a change.
//
//  The jail confines the EXPLORATION loop: every model command runs under
//  Seatbelt with no network and writes confined to the repo. But verification
//  (build + suite) runs OUTSIDE that jail, networked, through the ordinary
//  runner — it has to, since dependency resolution needs the network. That is
//  safe only because the model authors SOURCE, never the build command string
//  (the code-vs-command authorship split MaintainShellRunner leans on).
//
//  There is one hole in that split: a file the fixed build command EXECUTES.
//  `cargo build` runs `build.rs`. `npm run build` runs `package.json`
//  lifecycle scripts. `make` runs a `Makefile`. If the model EDITED one of
//  those in the loop, the un-jailed verification build then runs model-authored
//  code with the network and no write-confinement — a straight jail escape,
//  and it happens BEFORE the human ever sees the diff.
//
//  So a model edit to a build-script file must be caught BEFORE that build
//  runs. This file is only the pure detector; the edit loop decides what to do
//  with a hit — block outright, or surface it for an explicit, informed approval.
//
