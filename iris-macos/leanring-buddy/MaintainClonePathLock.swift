//
//  Mutual exclusion over a single clone's working tree.
//
//  Two independent code paths can want to rewrite the SAME source clone: the
//  crash-incident path (a confirmed break → Tier C novel fix) and the new
//  user-initiated on-demand editor. Both strip `.git` before their jailed
//  loop, restore it after, and — on any failure — run
//  `git checkout -- . && git clean -fd` to get back to a clean tree. If they
//  ever run at once on the same repo, those two `.git` strips, the two
//  reverts, and the two branch checkouts race and corrupt the working tree or
//  silently lose the in-flight edit. The on-demand path also deliberately
//  drops maintain mode's ask throttle (it exists to stop AI nagging, which is
//  wrong for a user-initiated act), so nothing else serializes these two.
//
//  This is that missing serialization: a per-clonePath latch, held for the
//  whole lifetime of one derivation and released when it finishes. It is not a
//  kernel lock — it is a set of in-use paths guarded on the main actor, which
//  is a correct mutex here because acquisition (check-then-insert) has no
//  `await` between the check and the insert, so no second task can interleave.
//
//  Both paths MUST canonicalize their clone path through this type's key so
//  that the incident path's raw `record.clonePath` and the on-demand path's
//  symlink-resolved path map to the same latch.
