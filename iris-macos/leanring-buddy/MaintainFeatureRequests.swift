//  MaintainFeatureRequests.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  The feature half of maintain mode. Bugs are found by watching; features
//  are found by LISTENING — the highest-signal, lowest-cost trigger is the
//  user simply saying what they wish an app did, while that app is in front.
//
//  This file does two small, honest things:
//    - recognizes a wish in a chat message ("I wish cue could…", "it should
//      really…", "why can't this…") and pools it as a demand signal, keyed
//      to a normalized signature so the same wish from many people adds up.
//    - answers "what do people most want for this app" from the pool, so Iris
//      can proactively suggest a top request — but only at k>=5, enforced
//      server-side, so a suggestion is never one person's wish echoed back.
//
//  It never implements anything itself: a wish the user asks Iris to build
//  runs through the SAME Tier C harness a novel fix does — jailed, bounded,
//  verified, forked. This file only turns talk into a pooled, ranked signal.
