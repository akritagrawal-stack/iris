//  MaintainFileEditApplier.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  A structured file-writing tool for the Tier C edit loop — the single
//  biggest gap between it and a real coding agent (Claude Code, SWE-agent),
//  found on a real dogfood run (Aug 22 2026, whimprflow): the agent had
//  correctly diagnosed the fix but spent 56 steps doing `sed -i '' '63,76d'`
//  line-surgery on ONE file, because the Seatbelt jail blocks heredocs (`cat
//  << 'EOF'` → "can't create temp file for here document: operation not
//  permitted"), leaving only `sed` (line numbers drift after each edit, so the
//  next edit corrupts the file) or `printf` (escaping hell for multi-line
//  code). It never reached a compilable state to declare DONE.
//
//  So the model no longer edits files through the jailed shell at all. It
//  emits a structured block — a whole-file ```write or a search/replace
//  ```edit — and IRIS's own code applies it: atomic, path-checked, jailed to
//  the repo, with no line-number drift and no shell-escaping. Reading, grep,
//  and inspection still go through the jailed shell (that is what the jail is
//  for — untrusted exploration); only the WRITE is lifted out, exactly the
//  code-vs-command split the whole design rests on. A write to a build-script
//  file is still refused here (it must go through the manifest channel), so
//  this never widens what the un-jailed verification build will execute.
//
//  Pure Foundation, no network. All path resolution is standardized AND
//  symlink-resolved and confined under the repo root, so a model-planted
//  symlink cannot walk a write out of the clone.
//
