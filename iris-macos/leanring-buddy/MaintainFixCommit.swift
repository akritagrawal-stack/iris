//  MaintainFixCommit.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  The one place a verified working tree becomes a commit on a fresh branch.
//
//  This block used to live near-verbatim in TWO places — the tail of
//  RecipeReplayEngine.applyVerifyAndCommit (a replayed pooled diff) and the
//  tail of MaintainTierCFixer.attemptFix (a novel BYO fix). Adding a third
//  caller (the user-initiated on-demand editor) would have made it three
//  copies of the same branch-naming + commit-script + trailer-block logic,
//  each free to drift. So it is factored here first, generalized over the two
//  things that legitimately differ between callers:
//
//    - the CHANGE ID (a crash signature for the incident path; a synthesized
//      request hash for on-demand) — load-bearing in the branch name and,
//      for callers that queue, the PatchQueue key.
//    - the TRAILER VOCABULARY — a crash fix, a replayed recipe, and an
//      on-demand edit each make different, HONEST claims. The structured
//      trailer block itself (a subject, a blank line, then `Key: value`
//      lines, and NO `Co-Authored-By`) is kept identical on purpose: AGPL
//      §5(a) "modified" notices and the founder-review packet's mechanical
//      checks both read it.
//
//  The mechanics — the date stamp, the `git checkout -b … || git checkout …`
//  branch create-or-switch, the single-quote-escaped `git commit` — are the
//  same for everyone and live only here.
//

    /// caller treats as proof the change landed — it goes into the reader's
    /// "committed on …" card, into the patch queue, into the fork backup — so a
    /// checkout that failed, a commit that found nothing staged, or a repo with
    /// no `user.email` configured all produced a confident report of a commit
    /// that does not exist. Whether the commit happened is checked the only way
    /// it can be: HEAD is read before and after, and if it did not move, it did
    /// not happen.
    ///
    /// Checking HEAD moved is necessary but was NOT sufficient. The checkout and
    /// the commit used to be one `;`-joined script, so if BOTH `git checkout -b`
    /// and the fallback `git checkout` failed, the `git commit` after them still
    /// ran — on whatever branch the clone happened to be on. HEAD moved, so the
    /// old guard passed, and this returned a branch name for a commit sitting on
    /// `main`. Every consumer of that name is then wrong in a different way: the
    /// reader is shown a branch that does not exist, the patch queue is keyed by
    /// it, and the fork backup pushes it — pushing nothing, or worse, pushing a
    /// commit the reader never agreed to put on their default branch.
    ///
    /// So the checkout is now its own step and is CONFIRMED before anything is
    /// committed. `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` is the read (not `rev-parse
    /// --abbrev-ref`, which cannot name an unborn branch and would fail on a
    /// first commit); a detached HEAD has no symbolic ref at all, so it refuses
    /// there too. If the branch is not the one asked for, nothing is committed
    /// and the tree is left exactly as the caller handed it over — which is what
    /// makes the caller's revert-and-report-honestly path correct.
