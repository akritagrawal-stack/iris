//                the BYO-only ClaudeAPI.
//    openai      the user's sk key, straight to api.openai.com — net-new

//                rather than an HTTP call — the "agent CLI" shape this

//                proof that it can without a caller change.

//  The whole interface is one turn: history in, one assistant text turn out.

/// domain is this type's name and whose code is the case's RUNTIME index, so
/// `error.localizedDescription` on one of these read, in full:
///
///     "The operation couldn’t be completed.
///      (Iris.MaintainModelProviderError error 0.)"
///
/// That is what a reader was actually shown when an app-edit run died, and
/// their own words afterwards were "I have the codex CLI?" — a fair question,
/// because nothing in that sentence is about a CLI, a login, or anything a
/// person could go and do about it. And "error 0" is `.requestFailed`: Swift
/// numbers the payload-carrying cases first, so the one case that CARRIES the
/// real explanation as a String is precisely the one whose explanation got
/// thrown away on the way out.
///

/// lapsed. This is that fix, carried across to the sibling enum it was never

/// a code. `LocalizedError` is conformed as well as the property added because
/// `userFacingMessage` is what call sites SHOULD reach for and
/// `localizedDescription` is what they reach for by accident; with
/// `errorDescription` wired up, the accident now yields the sentence instead of
/// the case index. The alternative — auditing every present and future call
