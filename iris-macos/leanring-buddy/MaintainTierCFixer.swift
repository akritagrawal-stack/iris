//
//  The last rung: no pooled recipe fit, the user confirmed the bug, and they
//  brought their own model access. A bounded, mini-swe-agent-shaped loop
//  derives a fix from scratch, then it faces the SAME verification gate every
//  other fix does — a novel fix earns no special trust for being clever.
//
//  The SAME loop also drives the user-initiated on-demand editor: a person
//  picks an app, says what they want changed (a bug fix or a feature), and the
//  request slots into the exact place the crash evidence would. That is the
//  whole point of the `MaintainEditTask` abstraction below — one jailed loop,
//  one `.git` strip/restore, one verify/commit tail, two ways in. The crash
//  path keeps its existing identity and verification contract; it just now
//  expresses itself as a `.crashFix` task.
//
//  Deliberately small and deliberately caged:
//    - BYO/OpenAI only (the funded proxy structurally can't run this, and its
//      budget couldn't sustain it — Agentless-shaped novel fixes still cost
//      ~15x a replay).
//    - No step budget (founder decision, Aug 20 2026): the loop runs until
//      the model declares DONE or the no-progress detector calls it stuck,
//      under a distant runaway backstop that is not a budget.
//    - Every command runs in the Seatbelt jail: writes confined to the repo,
//      no network. Fetch-and-run and exfiltration are off the table during
//      exploration; the network-needing build happens after, outside the
//      jail, through the ordinary runner.
//    - `.git` is stripped before the loop and restored after, so a clone
//      that already contains the upstream fix cannot be mined for the answer.
//    - Text ReAct, no tool-calling API: the model replies with ONE fenced
//      bash block or DONE. Simple to cap, simple to parse, provider-portable.

        Hold that edit for one step.

        Iris has an unconfirmed source change for this same bug report. That does not prove it was installed, that it failed, or that the cause is outside the source. Check the running copy or its build path before repeating the edit.

        So before your first edit, run ONE read-only command that inspects something other than this repository's source — whichever is plausible for this complaint:

        - the built or installed app rather than the code that makes it: `codesign -dvvv --verbose=4 <bundle>`, `codesign -d -r- <bundle>` (its designated requirement — what macOS actually matches a permission grant against), `plutil -p <bundle>/Contents/Info.plist`, `spctl -a -vvv <bundle>`, `xattr -p com.apple.quarantine <bundle>`
        - whether the installed copy was even built from this source: compare its binary's timestamp and signing identifier with what this tree produces
        - the app's stored state and config: the plist, the database, the files it reads at startup
        - the repo's build and install guidance: use `cat README.md`, `cat BUILD.md` or `cat CONTRIBUTING.md` for an existing document. A successful read satisfies this check; documentation is evidence, not permission.

        Then continue. If what you find changes nothing, say so in your next sentence and make the edit you were going to make. This costs one step and is not a veto.

        duration of this run, so every git command fails with "not a git \
        repository" no matter which directory you are in. The files on disk are \
        the whole of the evidence.
        - The JAILED SHELL has no network, and `rg` is not installed \
        there. Read and search the repository with `grep`, `sed -n`, \
        `cat`, `find`, `ls`, `head`, `tail`.
        - You DO have web search, as a normal tool of your own. Use it \
        whenever the change depends on something you do not already know \
        for certain — an API's real endpoints, request shape or auth \
        header, a library's current version or its actual option names, \
        whether a service really offers what the reader believes it \
        does. Guessing at an API you half-remember is the most expensive \
        mistake available here, and "I could not look it up" is no \
        longer true.
        - You may freely READ and grep build files — package.json, Cargo.toml, \
        Makefile, CMakeLists.txt and the rest. They often hold the scripts and \
        entry points that explain how the app runs. The hard constraint on them \
        is only on EDITING.
        - After you say DONE, Iris runs the resolved confined checks: \
        build `\(buildCommand ?? "(none - this repo has no build step Iris could resolve)")`, \
        test `\(testCommand ?? "(none - this repo has no test suite Iris could resolve)")`. \
