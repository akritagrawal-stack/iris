//
//  OnDemandEditCoordinator.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  The state machine behind a USER-INITIATED edit: the reader picks an
//  installed catalog app, says what they want changed (a bug fix or a
//  feature), and Iris edits the local source, verifies it, and commits it on a
//  branch — all under the reader's OWN model key. It is the second door into
//  the exact same jailed loop the crash path uses (MaintainTierCFixer), with
//  crash detection skipped entirely.
//
//  It reuses the engine and the two closure seams the incident path already
//  proved (a novel-fix attempt, a fork backup) but it does NOT inherit
//  MaintainIncidentCoordinator's MaintainAsk / rate-limit / mute machinery:
//  that exists to stop AI-initiated nagging about repeat crashes, and is
//  exactly wrong for an act the reader started themselves. So this is a
//  separate, longer-lived machine — closer to a guide session than to a single
//  ask — that mirrors the incident coordinator's closure-injection + published
//  status-line pattern and nothing else.
//
//  Every safety rail the design ratified is ON here and none is optional:
//    - Eligibility is fail-closed and RE-CHECKED LIVE at start, never trusting
//      a cached render flag: guide-source-clone provenance AND a home-contained
//      git working tree AND a BYO model key AND the Seatbelt sandbox AND a real
//      rebuild recipe for the app's stack, or the tool refuses with an honest
//      reason.
//    - A per-clonePath LOCK excludes the crash-incident path and any other
//      on-demand edit, so two `.git` strips / reverts can never race the tree.
//    - A DIRTY working tree is refused outright, so the engine's
//      revert-on-failure (`git clean -fd`) can never delete the reader's own
//      uncommitted work — it only ever cleans files Iris itself created.
//    - The free-text request is secret-scrubbed on the model-egress path
//      BEFORE it becomes any part of a prompt.
//    - The kind (bug fix vs feature) is always EXPLICIT, never inferred: it
//      drives the prompt, the commit trailer, and the honesty label, and a
//      misclassification there is a correctness/honesty bug, so a human picks
//      it. A FEATURE result is presented as "applied and rebuilt", never
//      "verified" — the engine structurally cannot elevate it.
//    - Build-script edits (build.rs, package.json scripts, Makefile, …) are
//      hard-blocked by the engine BEFORE the un-jailed verification build runs
//      them; this coordinator surfaces that honestly.
//    - Sharing is offered SEPARATELY and defaults to FORK-ONLY in the reader's
//      own namespace — never an automatic push to a third party's main.
//
//  This first slice stops at "committed on a branch": there is no rebuild /
//  terminate / relaunch of the running app (the hardest, most destructive,
//  most stack-specific piece is deferred), so the terminal state is the same
//  honest "Relaunch <App> to pick it up" the crash path already uses.
