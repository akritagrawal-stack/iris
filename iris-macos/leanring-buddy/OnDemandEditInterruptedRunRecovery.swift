//
//  What happens to an on-demand edit's files when Iris quits before the edit
//  is committed or reverted.
//
//  THE REPORT (Sep 3 2026). The card read: "Your clone has changes Iris won't
//  touch: your clone of WhimprFlow has 2 changes that aren't committed —
//  src-tauri/src/lib.rs (modified Sep 3), src-tauri/src/paste.rs (modified
//  Sep 3)." The reader had not touched either file. Iris had. The run log
//  (20260903-160125354-whimprflow.log) shows the engine applying edits to both
//  at 16:04:26, then stopping at 16:04:33 on "manifest consent requested: Add
//  the Rust crate block2 0.6 to src-tauri/Cargo.toml" — the consent card.
//  iris.log for that process ends there, and the next Iris process starts
//  twelve minutes later. Iris quit, or was relaunched, with the run parked on
//  the card. The engine had already written its edits into the working tree
//  and was awaiting a `CheckedContinuation` that died with the process: the
//  approve path (apply, build, commit) and the decline path (`git checkout --
//  . && git clean -fd`) both live PAST that continuation, so neither ran. The
//  next attempt on the app, sixteen minutes later, found Iris's own orphaned
//  edits and refused — blaming the reader for them.
//
//  THE FIX IS A RECORD ON DISK. The moment the engine reports files edited,
//  the run writes down which clone, which base commit, and which paths it
//  touched; the record goes away when the run commits, reverts, or is reset.
//  Two readers of the record: the app at LAUNCH (a crash, a force quit, a
//  relaunch for an update) and the app at QUIT (a clean quit mid-run). Both
//  call `recoverNow()`, which reverts EXACTLY the recorded paths — and only if
//  the tree is dirty in nothing else, and only if HEAD is still the recorded
//  base. A tree that also carries the reader's own work is left alone, and the
//  record stays so the dirty-clone card can say which of the files were
//  Iris's.
//
//  SYNCHRONOUS BY DESIGN. `applicationWillTerminate` gets a few seconds and no
//  run loop; a `Process` running git in the clone finishes in well under one.
//  Nothing here goes through the login-shell runner, which spawns a `zsh -l`
//  to learn the reader's PATH and is the wrong cost at quit.
