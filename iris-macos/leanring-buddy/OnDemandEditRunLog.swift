//
//  OnDemandEditRunLog.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  A plain-text, per-run log of ONE on-demand edit: the request, Iris's own
//  narration, every real command with its exit and output tail, the nudges and
//  waits, and the outcome — persisted so a failed run can be diagnosed after
//  the fact. It exists because a real dogfood failure (Aug 22 2026: "couldn't
//  converge... nothing was applied") left NOTHING to inspect: the whole
//  conversation lived only in memory, and `irisTrace`'s iris.log records
//  structure only by design.
//
//  This file is deliberately different from iris.log and does not weaken its
//  rule: it mirrors ONLY what the takeover terminal already displayed to the
//  reader (model-bound and displayed text is secret-scrubbed upstream on the
//  same egress paths), it never leaves the machine, it lives in its own
//  clearly-named directory (~/Library/Logs/Iris/edit-runs), and old runs are
//  pruned so the folder stays a handful of files.
//
//  Logging must never break a run: every filesystem miss is swallowed, and a
//  failed init simply means the run goes unlogged (the caller holds an
//  Optional and carries on).
