//
//  The guide step, rendered under the eye instead of inside the settings
//  dropdown.
//
//  WHY IT MOVED. A step card in the menu bar panel is a copy of the web page
//  with extra steps: the reader looks *away* from the thing they are supposed
//  to be doing, into a dropdown, to read a command. The eye is already sitting
//  in the corner of the screen watching the pointer, it can fly to a control
//  and hold there, and it is where every other Iris answer now appears. The
//  panel goes back to being settings, which is what `iris-macos/CLAUDE.md`
//  always said it was.
//
//  Everything in this file is a pure value except the view at the bottom, so
//  the wording — which is most of the judgement — is testable without a screen.
