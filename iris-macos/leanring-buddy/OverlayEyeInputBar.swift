//
//  OverlayEyeInputBar.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  The bar that appears under the eye when the eye is clicked, and the whole
//  conversation that happens inside it: the question, the working state, the
//  answer, and the next question.
//
//  WHY THE WHOLE EXCHANGE LIVES HERE. This bar used to take a question and then
//  open the menu bar panel to show the answer, which meant one conversation
//  spread across two windows: a lovely minimal bar that threw you somewhere else
//  the moment you actually used it. The eye is the interface. Clicking it opens
//  the bar, asking keeps you in the bar, and the answer arrives in the bar. The
//  menu bar panel is settings now — account, permissions, model, apps, quit —
//  and the gear beside the bar is the way to it.
//
//  WHY THIS IS ITS OWN WINDOW RATHER THAN PART OF THE OVERLAY. The overlay is
//  a full-screen, click-through, never-key window — deliberately so, because
//  everything the user clicks has to pass straight through it, and because it
//  must never take keyboard focus away from the app they are working in. A
//  text field needs the exact opposite of both. Putting the bar in its own
//  small `.nonactivatingPanel` gets both properties without compromising the
//  overlay: the panel is only as large as itself, so there is no click-through
//  question to answer, and a non-activating panel can become key *without
//  activating Iris*, so the user's app stays frontmost.
//
//  THE CLICK-THROUGH GUARANTEE IS UNAFFECTED BY THE BAR GROWING. The overlay's
//  mouse gate (`OverlayWindowMouseEventGate`) opens over the eye's 76pt square
//  and nowhere else, in every state of this bar. The bar's own clicks, scrolls
//  and selections never travel through the overlay at all — they are delivered
//  to this panel, which is a real window of its own. So when an answer makes the
//  bar taller, the interactive surface grows because the *panel* grew, and the
//  overlay stays click-through over every pixel of it. `OverlayEyeInteraction`
//  models both rectangles and `IrisEyeTests` pins the pair down together.
//
//  WHO HOLDS THE KEYBOARD, AND WHEN. The panel can become key, because a text
//  field in a window that cannot be key never sees a keystroke. But a panel that
//  *stays* key after the question has been sent goes on swallowing keystrokes
//  meant for the app the reader went back to — during an earlier verification
//  pass the literal characters the user typed into their own editor landed in
//  this bar. So key status is held only while a question is being composed, and
//  handed straight back on send. See `releaseTheKeyboardSoTheReadersOwnAppGetsItBack`.
