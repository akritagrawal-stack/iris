//  Dragging a screenshot onto the bar, and the reason it could not be done.
//
//  THE REPORT (Sep 3 2026): "i cant drag and drop screenshots into it because
//  when i click off it closes." Exactly right, and by design up to now: the
//  bar's click-outside monitor dismissed it on the LEFT MOUSE DOWN of any click
//  in another app. A drag starts with that same mouse down — on a Finder icon,
//  on the floating screenshot thumbnail — so the bar was gone before the
//  reader's hand had moved. There was nothing to drop onto.
//
//  MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. A two-process harness (a drag source in one process,
//  a drop target with Iris's global monitor in another, driven by real CGEvents
//  through the window server) established what the monitor actually sees while
//  another app runs a drag session:
//
//      leftMouseDown              seen, drag pasteboard changeCount unchanged
//      leftMouseDragged (x20)     seen; changeCount moved on the SECOND one
//      draggingEntered (ours)     ~500ms before the release
//      leftMouseUp                seen — 4ms BEFORE performDragOperation
//      performDragOperation       the drop, last
//
//  So deferring the dismissal from the press to the release is not enough on
//  its own: the release still lands before the drop and would tear the bar
//  down with the file in mid-air. Two earlier signals settle it, and this file
//  uses both: the bar's own `draggingEntered` (a drag is over us — the release
//  is going to be a drop), and the system drag pasteboard's change count (a
//  drag session began somewhere since the press — this is not a click). A
//  press that was never followed by either is a plain click outside, and the
//  bar goes away on its release exactly as it used to on its press. Nobody can
//  see the difference in a click; everybody can see it in a drag.
//
//  A RIGHT click is never the start of a drag and still dismisses at once.

/// the drop still never arrived: `NSHostingView` runs SwiftUI's own dragging
/// destination on internal subviews that sit in front of the host's own
/// methods, so the drag was caught there (and refused, there being no SwiftUI
/// `.onDrop`) before any override could run. Measured live — the callbacks
/// never fired while `registeredDraggedTypes` was full. So the drop is wired
/// the way the host is already listening for: a `DropDelegate` on the bar.
///
/// The dismissal fix does NOT depend on this: a drag onto the bar is kept
/// alive by the drag pasteboard's change count moving since the press
/// (`OverlayEyeInputBarClickOutsideDismissal`), which needs no cooperation
/// from the drop target at all. This delegate only turns an accepted drop into
/// attachments and lights the "drop to attach" state while a drag is over the
