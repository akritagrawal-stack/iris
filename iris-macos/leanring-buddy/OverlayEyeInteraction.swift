//  OverlayEyeInteraction.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  Everything about the on-screen eye being a *control* rather than a
//  decoration: how big its clickable region is, where that region sits in each
//  of the two coordinate spaces the overlay lives in, what a click on it does,
//  and what the input bar it opens offers to say.
//
//  All of it is deliberately free of AppKit and SwiftUI so it can be tested
//  without a screen. The one thing in this feature that is genuinely dangerous
//  — deciding which pixels of a full-screen, otherwise click-through overlay
//  are allowed to swallow a mouse click — is a pure function here, and
//  `IrisEyeTests` pins it down directly.
//
//  COORDINATE SPACES, since this file converts between them:
//
//    * **SwiftUI overlay coordinates** — origin at the top-left of *this
//      screen's* overlay window, y growing downward. This is the space the
//      eye's position is tracked in.
//    * **AppKit screen coordinates** — origin at the bottom-left of the main
//      display, y growing upward. This is the space `NSEvent.mouseLocation`
//      reports in and the space `NSWindow.setFrameOrigin` consumes.
//
//  Every conversion between the two lives in this file's
//  `convert…` helpers, so there is one place to get the y flip wrong.

// MARK: - The first-run setup helper

//  A brief, skippable walkthrough of how to use Iris, shown once on first
//  launch and re-openable from the settings panel.
//
//  WHY IT EXISTS. A tester who had installed Iris and granted every permission
//  still could not tell how to use it — his words: "when you first install the
//  app, it is hard to know how to use it, like using it in settings, to click
//  on the eye, things like that, so a setup helper … could be really cool." The
//  animated eye demo (`CompanionManager.triggerOnboarding`) shows the eye
//  moving; it never spells out the three things a new reader cannot guess: that
//  Control+Option summons Iris, that the eye by the pointer is where you ask and
//  edit, and that this panel is where the settings live. This is that, in
//  words, in Iris's own visual language.
//
//  Everything here is a pure value — the step wording (which is the whole
//  point), the forward/back navigation, the show-it-once gate, and the seen
//  flag's storage — so all of it is testable without a SwiftUI view. The card
//  that draws it lives in `CompanionPanelView`.
