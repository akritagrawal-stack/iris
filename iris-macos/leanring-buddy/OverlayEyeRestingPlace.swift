//  Where the eye sits when it is not doing anything, and how the reader moves
//  it.
//
//  It used to be one constant — `CGPoint(x: 58, y: 78)`, the top-left corner —
//  with no way to change it. That corner is not neutral for everyone: it is
//  where a lot of people keep the thing they are actually working in, and a
//  reader asked to be able to drag the eye somewhere else and have it stay.
//
//  Deliberately `nonisolated` and backed by `UserDefaults`, the same shape as
//  `AutopilotAutonomyGrant`, so the geometry can read it from any context
//  without an actor hop.
