//
//  Iris's eye, drawn on the screen overlay. This is a transcription of the
//  website's eye — `components/iris/IrisEye.tsx` for the structure and the
//  `.iris-eye*` rules in `app/globals.css` for every measurement — so the
//  thing that follows you around the desktop is recognisably the same
//  creature as the thing on publikhq.com. It replaced a blue triangle, which
//  was a cursor, not a companion.
//
//  The layering matches the website exactly:
//      track  → a ring carrying the conic progress arc
//      shell  → the dark eyeball
//      lid    → the pale, blinking, slightly tilted opening (it clips)
//      iris   → the striated blue disc that slides toward whatever is watched
//      pupil  → the ink centre
//      glint  → the highlight that makes it read as wet rather than printed
//
//  Where a `DS` token already carries the value it is used in preference to
//  the raw CSS hex, per the design system's own rule.
