//  OverlayWindow.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  System-wide transparent overlay window for the Iris companion.
//  One OverlayWindow is created per screen so the companion
//  seamlessly follows the cursor across multiple monitors.
//
//  The companion is Iris's eye — the same eye the website draws, see
//  `OverlayIrisEyeView.swift`. It used to be a blue triangle, which was a
//  second cursor chasing the first one. Everything the triangle *did* is
//  unchanged: it still rides beside the pointer, still flies a bezier arc to
//  a `[POINT:...]` target and back, still hides itself on the screens that
//  are not the one performing the flight. Only what is drawn has changed —
//  and the eye now watches whatever it is meant to be watching.
