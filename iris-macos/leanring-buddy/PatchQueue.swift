//
//  PatchQueue.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  Local fixes against a moving upstream, without divergence hell. A fix
//  Iris applied is not "the diff currently on disk" — it is a NAMED patch
//  keyed to its recipe and signature, recorded here the moment it lands, so
//  that when the app updates the queue can be popped, upstream pulled, and
//  every named patch replayed one at a time. A conflict then belongs to ONE
//  patch, not to an opaque merge — quilt's model, because forty years of
//  distro packaging found nothing better.
//
//  Two rules the replay honors, both paid for elsewhere first:
//    - a clean textual merge proves nothing; the verification gate re-runs
//      after every replay, unconditionally.
//    - when upstream lands its own version of a patch, the local one is
//      DROPPED and the supersession reported to the pool — fork hygiene and
//      a high-value signal ("stop proposing this, it's upstream now").
