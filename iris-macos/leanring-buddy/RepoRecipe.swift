//  Core value types for the Feature Engine's build/run recipe derivation
//  (plan §4). A `RepoRecipe` is what replaces the coarse, catalog-declared
//  `BreakAppStack → VerificationCommands` lookup: a per-repo description of how
//  to install/build/test/run/package the clone, derived by READING the repo,
//  with per-field confidence and provenance so every command that later runs
//  un-jailed is auditable back to the declarative signal that produced it.
//
//  Everything in this file is pure Foundation — no network, no SwiftUI, and
//  nothing here ever executes a target repo's code. Detectors only inspect
//  files; command strings are built here and adjudicated/executed elsewhere
//  (behind the classifier gate and staged consent, plan §5).
