//
//  RepoRecipeRustTauriDetector.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  One row of the Feature Engine's data-driven ecosystem registry (plan §4):
//  the Rust / Tauri detector. It statically inspects a clone and reports how to
//  build / test / run / package it, WITHOUT ever executing the repo's own code
//  and WITHOUT touching the network. Every command it emits is lifted from — or
//  keyed on — the repo's own declarative config (`Cargo.toml`,
//  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`), which is precisely what keeps the later
//  un-jailed build code-adjudicated rather than model-authored (plan §5).
//
//  Precedence inside this one detector mirrors the global cascade (plan §4): a
//  real Tauri config (`tauri.conf.json`) is the highest-confidence signal and,
//  when present, decides the whole recipe — a Tauri app is a desktop app, so its
//  runtime shape is unambiguously pure-local. Absent a Tauri config, a bare
//  `Cargo.toml` yields the ordinary cargo build/test/run recipe, with `cargo run`
//  offered only when the crate actually declares a runnable binary.
//
//  Pure Foundation: no network, no SwiftUI, and nothing here executes anything
//  from the repo. All file access goes through `RepoRecipeFiles` — the audited,
//  size-capped, repo-confined read surface — so a hostile manifest path can
//  never walk this detector out of the clone.
//
