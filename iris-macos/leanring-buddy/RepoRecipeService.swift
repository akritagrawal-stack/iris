//
//  RepoRecipeService.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  The Feature Engine's recipe-derivation front door (plan §4/§5): the single
//  entry point that replaces the coarse, catalog-declared
//  `BreakAppStack → VerificationCommands` lookup with a per-repo `RepoRecipe`
//  DERIVED by reading the actual clone. It runs every ecosystem detector in this
//  build, mines `.github/workflows/*.yml` for CI `run:` steps, and MERGES all of
//  those signals per field by trust precedence — so the recipe a consumer later
//  runs is code-adjudicated from declarative signals, never model-authored, and
//  every winning command is auditable back to the signal (and provenance) that
//  produced it.
//
//  Everything here is pure Foundation static inspection: it only reads files
//  (through `RepoRecipeFiles`, or a contained directory listing for the fixed
//  `.github/workflows` folder), never executes anything from the repo, and never
//  touches the network — the same invariant every detector holds. The command
//  strings are only BUILT and SELECTED here; they are classifier-screened and
//  executed elsewhere, behind staged consent (plan §5).
//
//  Merge semantics (the load-bearing logic, mirroring every build-detection tool
//  the plan surveyed):
//    - Per field, gather every detector's command plus any CI `run:` command.
//    - The winner is the candidate with the HIGHEST-TRUST provenance
//      (explicitProjectConfig > ciWorkflowStep > frameworkRegistryDefault >
//      genericEcosystemDefault > sandboxedTrial > unknown, i.e. the lowest
//      `RecipeSignalProvenance.trustRank`); ties are broken by higher confidence,
//      then by detector order (stable).
//    - When candidates DISAGREE on the command (a genuine conflict — two
//      lockfiles, a Makefile vs. a framework default, a CI step vs. a generic
//      default), the winner is kept but the merged confidence is LOWERED so the
//      ambiguity surfaces to the clarification layer (plan §7) instead of being
//      hidden by a silent last-writer-wins pick.
