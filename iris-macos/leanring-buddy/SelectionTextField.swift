//
//  SelectionTextField.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  Taking an image off the pasteboard when the reader presses cmd-V in the bar.
//
//  THE REPORT. Two testers, two rounds apart, wrote the same sentence:
//
//      "I CANNOT PASTE IMAGES INTO THE CHAT BOX."
//
//  and the runtime evidence beside it said why: Iris asked the pasteboard for
//  text, three times, and never once asked it for an image. Recreated against
//  HEAD by hosting the bar's own field construction in a panel with an image on
//  the pasteboard and pasting into it — the app asked for `public.utf8-plain-text`
//  and `public.rtf`, asked for neither `public.png` nor `public.tiff`, and the
//  field ended the paste with the same nought characters it started with. The
//  same keystroke on the same field with TEXT on the pasteboard pasted fine.
//
//  So nothing is broken in the paste path. The bar's field is a SwiftUI
//  `TextField` bound to a `String`, its field editor is a plain-text one, and a
//  plain-text field editor's readable pasteboard types are text types. Handed a
//  picture it does the only thing it can do, which is nothing — and doing
//  nothing, silently, is what the reader experienced.
//
//  WHY THIS FILE IS CALLED WHAT IT IS. `SelectionTextField` is the class name
//  AppKit's accessibility hierarchy reports for the SwiftUI field the bar
//  builds — it is the name in the dumps in `Test6TakeoverPanelReproTests` and
//  in `GuideAutopilotTakeoverPanel`'s header. This file is the paste behaviour
//  that field never had.
//
//  WHY THE FIELD ITSELF IS NOT REPLACED. It would have to be: the bar drives
//  focus through `@FocusState` and `.focused(...)`, submits through `.onSubmit`,
//  and an `NSViewRepresentable` in its place would have to reimplement all of
//  it — a great deal of risk to buy a paste. Instead a zero-size view sits in
//  the same window and claims cmd-V *before* the field editor is offered it.
//  `NSWindow` walks its view tree with `performKeyEquivalent(with:)` before the
//  main menu's Paste item is ever consulted, so an image paste is intercepted
//  and a text paste is waved straight through by returning false. Measured in
//  the same harness: with nothing claiming cmd-V, the window reported the
//  keystroke swallowed by no view at all — that slot was empty and is now used.
//
//  WHAT AN INTERCEPTED IMAGE DOES. It is attached to the NEXT message rather
//  than typed into the field, because there is no way to put a picture inside a
//  `String`. `OverlayEyePastedImageAttachment` holds up to a few of them, the
//  bar draws each as a thumbnail with a remove control, and the message that
//  follows carries them ALONGSIDE the automatic screen capture — see
//  `CompanionScreenCaptureUtility.imageryForOneChatMessage`. (It used to carry
//  the picture INSTEAD of the screen. Founder ruling, Sep 3 2026: "i dont want
//  iris to read just the image attachment, it should read both my screen and
//  the image.")
//
//  SINCE SEP 3 2026 THE SAME ATTACHMENT ARRIVES THREE WAYS: pasted here,
//  dropped onto the bar (`OverlayEyeBarDropDelegate`), or picked with
//  the bar's attach button. The type names still say "pasted" because that is
//  where they were born; the reader helpers below serve all three.
//
//  WHERE THE BYTES ARE ALLOWED TO GO. Onto the model route this message uses,
//  and nowhere else. They are never written to disk: the transcript store
//  records the reader's typed text only, the conversation history the API is
//  handed carries text placeholders only, and `OverlayEyePastedImage`'s own
//  description names the size and the byte count and never the content, so an
//  image cannot be laundered into a log by an interpolation somebody adds later.
