//
//  The gate between "a patch applied" and "a fix is real". Iris is both
//  prosecutor and defendant here — it authors the test AND the fix — and
//  the agentic-coding literature is unambiguous about how that ends without
//  hard checks: patches that pass their own test while breaking six others,
//  tests quietly rewritten to match the patch, "fixes" that are the answer
//  key retrieved rather than derived.
//
//  So the harness runs legs, and every leg is a hard block:
//
//    leg 1   the repro fails BEFORE the patch        (proves the test sees the bug)
//    leg 2   the repro passes AFTER the patch        (proves the patch does something)
//    leg 3   revert the patch, repro fails again     (proves the test wasn't tautological)
//            — then re-apply. One extra build; the only defense there is
//            against a self-verifying agent when nobody else wrote an oracle.
//    suite   the app's own full test suite stays green (PASS_TO_PASS)
//    build   the app still builds at all
//
//  A replayed recipe arrives with no repro test — its evidence came from
//  other machines — so legs 1–3 are skipped and it earns only `applied` +
//  build + suite, never a `verified` outcome without the full gate. The
//  outcome vocabulary keeps those separate on purpose.
//
//  Two additive final steps run AFTER every leg above passes (Feature Engine
//  plan §9), never in place of them:
//
//    cheat   scan the applied diff for the tamper signatures a self-grading
//            agent reaches for (FeatureEditVerificationAudit) — tautological
//            asserts, swallowed catches, focused/skipped tests, re-recorded
//            snapshots, a test mocking the module under test, a test/assert
//            count drop. A hit blocks exactly as hard as the weakens-tests
//            check it generalizes.
//    ladder  translate the signals the legs ALREADY collected into an honest
//            evidence log + the highest rung that evidence earns
//            (FeatureEditVerificationLadder). The rung is OBSERVED facts, never
//            a self-rated number, and is attached only after the cheat scan is
//            clean so a blocked run can never carry a rung implying it wasn't.
//
//  The binary earnsVerifiedFix/earnsCleanApply verdicts are untouched — the
//  rung and evidence log are added ALONGSIDE them, never in their place.
