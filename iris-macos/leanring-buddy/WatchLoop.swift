//  Notices when the reader has actually done the step they are on, and moves the
//  guide along without being asked to. This is the difference between Iris and a
//  chat box with a guide inside it.
//
//  `docs/iris-assistant-protocol.md` §7 is the contract, and §5 is the set of
//  privacy rules this file exists to keep. Both are implemented literally.
//
//  THE LADDER. Every rung is cheaper than the one below it, and the loop stops
//  at the first rung that can answer:
//
//    0. Is a step with a `watch` block even open? If not, nothing runs at all.
//    1. Is Iris allowed to look right now? Paused, secure input, a sensitive
//       step, an excluded app in front — each one means no capture happens.
//    2. Has the screen meaningfully changed since the last frame? One ~256 px
//       grayscale capture and a 64-bit difference hash answer this, and the
//       overwhelmingly common answer — "no" — costs nothing else.
//    3. Do the local signals settle it? Frontmost app, window title, a tool's
//       version, the HEAD of a clone, an accessibility element. Microseconds,
//       no network, nothing leaves the machine.
//    4. Only then, and only if the step declares a `visual` expectation, one
//       model call — under a hard budget of ≥ 10 s apart and ≤ 8 per step.
//
//  WHY THE LADDER IS SHAPED THIS WAY. The naive loop — screenshot every couple
//  of seconds and ask a model each time — is roughly 1,800 model calls an hour
//  per reader, which is unaffordable, and it means a running record of somebody's
//  screen leaving their machine for no reason. Rung 2 is what makes the common
//  case free: a reader reading a step is not changing their screen, so no frame
//  after the first one costs anything at all.
//
//  WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY CANNOT DO. It has no file API, no logging of
//  frames, and no stored property that can hold an image. A screenshot exists
//  only as a local `let` inside the one function that sends it, for exactly as
//  long as that call is in flight. The only thing the loop keeps between ticks
//  is a 64-bit hash, which is not an image and cannot be turned back into one.
