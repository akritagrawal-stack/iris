//
//  The pure decision logic behind the founder's Sep 2 2026 override: after a
//  green build, the fresh copy is installed OVER the reader's installed app
//  rather than launched from the clone's build dir. The two things worth
//  pinning here are which copy counts as "the installed app to replace"
//  (never the clone's own build output; /Applications wins) and where the
//  pre-delivery snapshot for undo is kept. The ditto/replace filesystem work
//  itself has no unit coverage for the same reason the rest of this service
//  does not — the harness cannot copy real app bundles — so it stays a
//  supervised dogfood, like the relaunch mechanics above it.
