//  BUG 4, TEST 9 (Iris 0.9.6 build 22): "Edit this app click shows nothing."
//
//  THE FIELD SCENARIO, from the cofounder's own runtime log, in order:
//
//    07:03:42Z  Iris relaunches (pid 51799) and resumes the kneecap iOS guide
//               with autopilot driving it — the centered terminal takeover is up.
//    07:06:08Z  "drive: step[12] id=run kind=open exec=false"
//               "drive: step run → MANUAL branch, waiting at gate (return)"
//               "takeover: PARKED + set readerMustManuallyContinue=true,
//                showsTerminalFace=true, title=Plug in your iPhone and press play"
//               The takeover slides to the corner and WAITS on the reader. It is
//               never torn down again in the whole log.
//    07:06→07:18  The reader spends fifteen minutes asking Iris about Xcode and
//               the missing iOS simulator runtime — thirteen exchanges in the
//               eye's bar, the last at 07:18:10Z. So the bar is open, and it is
//               showing a conversation.
//    07:19:45Z  "stack: nitroai not in the curated table — derived electron from
//                /Users/akrit/NitroAI"
//               That line is `CompanionManager.appStack(forSlug:)`, which only
//               runs from `requestOnDemandEdit(forEntry:)`. The reader clicked
//               "Edit this app" on NitroAI in the settings panel, and the click
//               WAS accepted: the pick ran, the app was resolved, the coordinator
//               moved on.
//               Nothing appeared. No edit-run file was ever written, because the
//               reader was never shown anything to answer.
//
//  WHAT THESE TESTS DRIVE. The real settings-panel section view, hosted in a real
//  NSPanel, clicked with a real NSEvent through the panel's own `sendEvent` —
//  which runs the real `onEditApp` closure `CompanionPanelView` supplies, the real
//  `CompanionManager.requestOnDemandEdit(forEntry:)`, the real stack derivation
//  off a real git clone on disk, and the real `OnDemandEditCoordinator.pickApp`.
//  Then the real `OverlayEyeInputBarView` is rendered into a real off-screen
//  window either side of that click and MEASURED, the way `Test7OverlaySilenceRepro`
//  measures it — because "shows nothing" is a claim about pixels, and the only
//  honest way to test it is to draw them.
//
//  WHAT IS ACTUALLY WRONG (and it is not where the bug report points). The click
//  chain is fine end to end. The blocker is `OverlayEyeInputBar.swift`'s
//  `theCenteredTakeoverIsCoveringTheScreen` (L586-595):
//
//      (guideSessionController.autopilotIsShownAsTakeover
//          && !guideSessionController.readerHasFinishedTheGuide)
//          || companionManager.onDemandEditTakeoverIsUp
//
//  Parking a manual step sets `readerMustManuallyContinue`; it does NOT clear
//  `autopilotIsShownAsTakeover` (only `stopAutopilot()` / finishing the guide
//  does). So that flag was true for the whole fifteen minutes — and it gates two
//  things that have nothing to do with the guide it is about:
//
//    1. the bar's top-level if/else (L599-742): while it is true the bar renders
//       ONLY the ask field and the exchange. `MaintainAskCard`, `OnDemandEditCard`
//       and `finishedEditsList` are not in the layout at all, whatever phase the
//       edit coordinator is in;
//    2. `anAppIsOpenForEditing` (L957): `guard !theCenteredTakeoverIsCoveringTheScreen`
//       — which is what would otherwise turn the field into the "NitroAI · Ask |
//       Edit" composer that the `.describe` phase the pick just entered is drawn
//       as.
//
//  A guide that is parked waiting for the reader to plug in a phone therefore
//  swallows the entire surface of an edit on a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT app. The pick
//  succeeded and had nowhere to appear.
//
//  These tests do not grep source. Every assertion is either state the running
//  app reaches or the height and pixels the real views actually draw.
