//  Bug5PnpmChurnAndApprovalEndToEndTests.swift
//  leanring-buddyTests
//
//  THE WHOLE CYCLE, driven the way the reader drove it. Bug 5 is two defects
//  that feed each other, and `Bug5PnpmChurnAndApprovalReproTests` pins each one
//  against the piece that owns it — the composed build command, and
//  `OnDemandEditDirtyTreeReport`. Neither of those, on its own, is what Akrit
//  did. What he did was tap "fix this", and this file is that tap:
//
//      pick the app → describe the change → approve the plan → start
//        → the preflight gate reads `git status --porcelain`
//        → the jailed edit loop writes real code into the clone
//        → the un-jailed verification build runs the command Iris composed
//        → the change is committed on an `iris/edit-…` branch
//        → the card says "Applied on branch …"
//        → and what the finished run leaves behind does not refuse the next one.
//
//  Everything above is production code. The ONLY thing faked is the model
//  transport: a `MaintainModelProviding` that replays two turns instead of
//  reaching a network. The coordinator and its gates, `MaintainTierCFixer`, the
//  Seatbelt jail, `MaintainShellRunner`, `RepoRecipeService`,
//  `VerificationHarness`, git, pnpm, esbuild and cargo are all real, and the
//  repository is a real one on disk.
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE REPRO. The repro proves the two rules.
//  It cannot prove they COMPOSE: that a run which is no longer refused reaches
//  a build that now works; that the build actually COMPILED the change rather
//  than merely exiting 0; and that what the finished run leaves behind does not
//  refuse the run after it. Each of those is a seam between the two halves, and
//  a seam is where a fix to one half quietly fails the other. Measured against
//  the pre-fix tree (0f421ba) the first test below fails at the gate, before the
//  engine is entered; had only the gate been fixed it would fail at the build
//  instead, with `ui/dist/main.js` never written.
//
//  It is deliberately self-contained — its own fixture, its own driver — so it
//  can be compiled and run alone, which is what a regression guard is asked to
//  do at the moment somebody suspects a regression.
