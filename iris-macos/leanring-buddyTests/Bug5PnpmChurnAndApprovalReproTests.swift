//
//  THE REPORT. Test 10, Akrit, Iris 0.9.7 build 23, on his WhimprFlow clone
//  (a Tauri app: Rust under `src-tauri/`, the frontend and its `build` script
//  under `ui/`). One cycle, in the order his log records it:
//
//    11:49:33  run 1 — "not started: the clone has uncommitted changes
//              (ui/pnpm-workspace.yaml)". He had never opened that file.
//    …         he taps "Set aside and continue"; Iris stashes the change as
//              `iris/set-aside-2026-09-02` and re-runs.
//    …         run 3 edits five source files and verifies with
//                  build=(cd 'ui' && pnpm build) && cargo build --release \
//                        --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
//              → "verification failed (build)".
//    …         the repair round reads ui/pnpm-workspace.yaml and the README,
//              then gives up: BLOCKED — "pnpm fails its dependency-status
//              preflight before compiling any source because esbuild is
//              unapproved in the global pnpm store; run
//              `cd ui && pnpm approve-builds --all`".
//    12:28:41  ui/pnpm-workspace.yaml is dirty AGAIN, now holding
//
//                  allowBuilds:
//                    esbuild: set this to true or false
//
//              which nobody typed — pnpm wrote it, while failing. The next run
//              walks straight back into 11:49:33's refusal. That is the loop.
//
//  It is ONE bug with two halves that feed each other, and this file
//  reproduces both against real tools rather than a description of them:
//
//    HALF 1 — the verification build. `RepoRecipeRustTauriDetector` lifts the
//      frontend hook out of tauri.conf.json verbatim ("pnpm build") and composes
//      the verification build from it. Modern pnpm refuses to install a package
//      whose build script has not been reviewed (ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS), and
//      since pnpm 11 a bare `pnpm <script>` runs its own dependency-status
//      check first — so on a fresh clone the composed command dies inside an
//      install pnpm started by itself, before one line of the model's code is
//      compiled. The run is judged as if the change did not build.
//
//    HALF 2 — the dirty-clone gate. `OnDemandEditCoordinator`'s preflight
//      (the `git status --porcelain` at OnDemandEditCoordinator.swift:1163,
//      read by `OnDemandEditDirtyTreeReport`) treats every uncommitted path as
//      the reader's own work worth refusing for. It has no notion of package
//      manager BOOKKEEPING — the placeholder pnpm just wrote, a generated
//      lockfile — which is disposable machine output that the tool regenerates
//      on demand. So the failing build in half 1 manufactures exactly the dirt
//      that makes the NEXT run refuse before it starts. Test 9 shows the same
//      shape one package manager over: that kneecap checkout's only dirty file
//      was `bun.lock`, written the second `bun install` succeeded.
//
//  What is real here, and deliberately so — a stub pnpm could only ever assert
//  what its author already believed:
//    • a real git repository in a temp directory under $HOME, shaped like
//      WhimprFlow (src-tauri/tauri.conf.json + Cargo crate, ui/ frontend);
//    • a real pnpm, pinned by the fixture's own `packageManager` field so the
//      gate under test is the one modern pnpm actually enforces (this Mac's
//      default pnpm is 10.0.0, whose gate is warn-only — a fixture that let it
//      decide would pass while proving nothing);
//    • a real esbuild dependency, whose postinstall script is the unreviewed
//      build script the whole failure turns on;
//    • the real `RepoRecipeService` → `MaintainTierCFixer.resolvedVerificationCommands`
//      composition that printed the command in the log, run through the real
//      `MaintainShellRunner` and judged by the real `VerificationHarness`;
//    • the real `OnDemandEditDirtyTreeReport`, fed the real porcelain that the
//      real failure left behind.
//
//  WHERE THE CONTRACT LIVES, for whoever fixes this: the churn suites below
//  assert through `OnDemandEditDirtyTreeReport`, because that is the type the
//  gate consults and the one that turns "what git said" into "what the reader
//  is told". A fix that instead decides churn-vs-work at the call site must
//  move these assertions to wherever the decision lands — the CONTRACT is
//  "a clone whose only dirt is a package manager's own bookkeeping does not
//  stop a run", not the property it is spelled with.
