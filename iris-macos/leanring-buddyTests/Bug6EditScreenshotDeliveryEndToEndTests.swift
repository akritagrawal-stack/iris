//
//  THE WHOLE TAP, and the image really leaving this process. Bug 6 is one
//  missing picture: Akrit typed "Can you do what the image says?" over a
//  Google Doc, WhimprFlow is a menu-bar app with no window to photograph, so
//  `appWindowScreenshotPNG` was nil, so the opening turn — the only turn that
//  may carry an image — carried none, and the model correctly reported that
//  the referenced image was not in the request.
//
//  `Bug6EditScreenshotDeliveryReproTests` pins that mechanism. It stops three
//  steps short of what the reader actually experiences, and each of those steps
//  is a place a fix can be green and still not work:
//
//    1. its edit worker is an object in THIS process, so no image byte ever
//       crosses a process boundary. The field provider was Codex, which
//       delivers a picture by writing a FILE and passing `--image <path>` to a
//       child process — the repro builds that argument vector with
//       `CodexExecInvocation.arguments` and runs nothing;
//    2. it never reaches an ending: its run stops at the model's second turn
//       with the verification pair stubbed to `true`, so "the reader got their
//       change instead of a refusal" is not asserted anywhere;
//    3. it connects the reader's-screen seam BY HAND. Deleting the three lines
//       in `CompanionManager` that connect it in production would leave the
//       repro green and every real run blind again.
//
//  This file closes all three.
//
//  WHAT IS REAL HERE:
//    • a real git repository under $HOME shaped like his WhimprFlow clone;
//    • the real `OnDemandEditCoordinator` driven the way the card drives it —
//      pick, describe, clarify, approve, start — through its real eligibility,
//      provenance, clone-lock and dirty-tree gates;
//    • the real `MaintainTierCFixer` loop behind it, the real Seatbelt jail,
//      the real un-jailed verification build, the real cheat scan, the real
//      adversarial reviewer, the real commit onto an `iris/edit-…` branch;
//    • the real `CodexMaintainProvider.runCodexExec` — a real child process,
//      spawned with the real argument vector, fed the real prompt on stdin,
//      handed the real PNG as a real file on disk;
//    • the real `CompanionManager` wiring, asserted where production installs
//      it rather than where a test could install it for itself.
//
//  WHAT IS FAKED, and it is one thing: the `codex` binary. This Mac has no
//  Codex CLI, and a guard must not depend on one being signed in. In its place
//  is a REAL executable — a script — that reads its own argv, opens the file it
//  was pointed at, and decides its answer from what actually arrived. That is
//  the whole point: the stand-in cannot know whether Iris sent a picture unless
//  a picture really landed on its disk, so "the image was delivered" is read
//  off a second process's filesystem rather than off an in-process field.
//
//  WHAT IS STILL NOT REAL, and why. Nothing here calls ScreenCaptureKit. A test
//  binary holds no Screen Recording grant, so a real capture could only ever
//  return nil — it would pass this file for the wrong reason — and asking for
//  the grant would put a system prompt in front of the founder mid-run. So the
//  reader's screen arrives through the same injected seam production fills from
//  `OnDemandEditAppEvidence.captureReadersScreenPNG()`, and the third test below
//  is what pins production to actually fill it.
//
//  PROVEN TO GUARD: see the commit message. Against the pre-fix tree the fix's
//  seam does not exist, and `theSameRunWithNoReadersScreenEndsExactlyAsTheFieldRunDid`
//  — which names no post-fix symbol — is the negative control that shows the
//  ending in the first test is caused by the picture and not by the script.
