//
//  THE REPORT. Test 10, Akrit, Iris 0.9.7 build 23, on his WhimprFlow clone.
//  He had a Google Doc open on his screen holding the request he wanted made,
//  and typed into the edit card:
//
//      Can you do what the image says?
//
//  The document said, verbatim:
//
//      The whimprflow engine is a bit bad, can we edit the local model it uses,
//      or connect it to CLI? …
//
//  What his own run log records, in order (run 2 of the cycle, 18:50:22Z):
//
//      Request: Can you do what the image says?
//      [11:50:42] memory: 3 prior run(s) injected
//      [11:50:42] runtime evidence: its recent log output      ← LOG ONLY
//      [11:50:50] iris: Opening the settings and hotkey sources …
//      [11:50:50] $ sed -n '1,260p' crates/whimpr-core/src/settings.rs; …
//      [11:50:50] exit 0 (0.1s)
//      [11:50:57] iris: BLOCKED: The referenced image is not present in the
//                 request, so its requested behavior cannot be identified
//                 reliably from the repository alone. QUESTION: Please attach
//                 the image or paste the text shown in it.
//
//  And the packet's own reading of the same window: "ScreenCaptureKit
//  enumerated on-screen content at 11:50:22.572 … The second run nevertheless
//  ended with `The referenced image is not present in the request`. This
//  supports a handoff/payload failure between the visible captured screen and
//  the edit-model request, not a general screen-recording failure."
//
//  THE MECHANISM, which this file reproduces rather than restates. The whole
//  edit engine has exactly ONE source of an image, `OnDemandEditAppEvidence`'s
//  `captureFrontWindowPNG(macBundleId:)`, and it can only ever photograph the
//  TARGET APP'S OWN front window: it filters ScreenCaptureKit's shareable
//  windows to `owningApplication.bundleIdentifier == macBundleId && isOnScreen
//  && width >= 200 && height >= 150`. WhimprFlow is a menu-bar app (LSUIElement)
//  — no window clears that filter — so the enumeration the packet saw succeed
//  returned an empty list, `appWindowScreenshotPNG` was nil, and
//  `OnDemandEditRuntimeEvidence` reached the engine carrying log text and
//  nothing else. `MaintainTierCFixer` attaches `appWindowScreenshotPNG` to the
//  opening turn (MaintainTierCFixer.swift:850) and nowhere else, so nil there
//  means zero image bytes on the wire, on every provider. The reader's SCREEN —
//  the thing "what the image says" actually refers to, and the exact capture
//  chat performs for every ordinary question through
//  `CompanionScreenCaptureUtility` — is never asked for, on any code path.
//  The model's BLOCKED was therefore correct: it reported precisely what it
//  had been sent.
//
//  WHAT IS REAL HERE, and deliberately so:
//    • a real git repository under $HOME shaped like his clone (src-tauri/ +
//      ui/ + crates/whimpr-core/), holding the very files run 2's first jailed
//      command read, and a real pnpm project pinned to THIS Mac's real pnpm;
//    • the real `OnDemandEditCoordinator` driven the way the card drives it —
//      pick, describe, clarify, approve the plan, start — through its real
//      eligibility, provenance, clone-lock and dirty-tree gates;
//    • the real `MaintainTierCFixer.attemptOnDemandEdit` behind it, wired from
//      the runtime evidence exactly as `defaultPerformOnDemandEdit` wires it,
//      running its real Seatbelt-jailed loop against that repository;
//    • the real `CodexExecInvocation.arguments` (the field provider was Codex)
//      built from the conversation the engine actually produced, so "no image
//      bytes crossed the process boundary" is read off the command line rather
//      than assumed. The Codex CLI is not installed on this Mac and is not
//      needed here: the argument vector is a pure function that runs nothing.
//    • a real PNG, rendered with AppKit, standing for the document he was
//      looking at — so "the image that never arrived" is a concrete payload
//      with bytes rather than a description of one.
//
//  WHAT IS NOT REAL, and why. Nothing in this file calls ScreenCaptureKit. A
//  test binary holds no Screen Recording grant, so a real capture here could
//  only ever return nil — it would prove the bug by accident, for the wrong
//  reason — and asking for the grant would put a system prompt in front of the
//  founder mid-run. The windowless app is therefore modelled at the seam the
//  coordinator already injects (`gatherRuntimeEvidenceForApp`), returning
//  exactly what the real gatherer returns for an LSUIElement app: real composed
//  log text from `OnDemandEditAppEvidence.composedRuntimeContext`, and a nil
//  screenshot.
//
//  WHERE THE CONTRACT LIVES, for whoever fixes this. The contract is "a run
//  whose request is about something on the reader's screen must send the model
//  an image of that screen, and must say what it sent" — NOT "the coordinator
//  has a property named X". A test binary can never capture a screen for real,
//  so the fix has to expose the reader's-screen source as an injectable seam
//  the way `gatherRuntimeEvidenceForApp` already is, and this file's driver has
//  ONE marked place (`wireTheReadersScreenSourceHereWhenTheFixLands`) where that
//  seam gets connected to `Bug6ReadersScreen.documentScreenshotPNG`. Connect it
//  there and this repro turns green; move the assertions only if the fix puts
//  the decision somewhere else entirely.
