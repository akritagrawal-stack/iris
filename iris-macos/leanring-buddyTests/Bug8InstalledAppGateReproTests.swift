//
//  Bug 8 from the cofounder's Test 9 report (Iris 0.9.6 build 22, kneecap on
//  his Mac): "Install Xcode" was put in front of a reader who already had
//  Xcode 26.6 installed, and the chat assistant that was then asked about it
//  spent thirteen turns guessing because nothing had ever told it whether an
//  iOS Simulator runtime existed on the machine.
//
//  == HALF ONE: the gate ==
//
//  The install was already running unattended when it hit the step. From
//  `iris.log`, verbatim, with the first two timestamps 221ms apart:
//
//      07:04:09.639Z  drive: build-editor result=succeeded
//      07:04:09.640Z  drive: step[8] id=install-xcode kind=open exec=false
//      07:04:09.861Z  drive: step install-xcode -> MANUAL branch, waiting at gate (return)
//      07:04:09.861Z  takeover: PARKED + set readerMustManuallyContinue=true,
//                     showsTerminalFace=true, title=Install Xcode
//      07:04:10.341Z  pointing/model: asked for step=Install Xcode
//      ...
//      07:04:35.791Z  gate: reader finished step 8 - advancing and resuming autopilot
//
//  Twenty-six seconds of a reader being asked to install software they already
//  had, ending in them telling Iris so by hand. Step 8 of the published kneecap
//  iOS branch is `kind: open`, `href` to the App Store, and its watch block
//  declares exactly one expectation: `foregroundApp com.apple.dt.Xcode`.
//
//  Why it parks: `driveAutopilotFromTheCurrentStep`'s manual-step branch has
//  ONE way to skip a gate, `everyToolThisStepWatchesForIsAlreadyPresent`, and
//  that function returns false for any expectation that is not `.toolVersion`
//  (`guard case .toolVersion(let toolName) = expectation else { return false }`)
//  - deliberately, per its own doc comment. A `.foregroundApp` expectation
//  therefore can never satisfy it, `stepIsFinishedOnceIrisHasOpenedIt` is false
//  because the watch block is non-empty, and the loop falls through to
//  `handTheCurrentStepBackToTheReader()`. Nothing anywhere in that path asks
//  whether the app the step is gating on is already on the disk - even though
//  `GuideSessionController.installedDesktopAppCheck`, the inventory-backed
//  "is this bundle installed?" closure CompanionManager already injects, is
//  sitting right there and is used by the resume reality-check.
//
//  The first two tests are the pair the dossier asks for: installed -> the
//  install must carry on by itself; not installed -> the gate must stay exactly
//  as it is today. Both drive the REAL `GuideSessionController` and the REAL
//  `GuideAutopilotRunner` against the published kneecap iOS branch, served over
//  `URLProtocol` the way `GET /api/iris/guides/kneecap` serves it, resumed at
//  step 6 so the loop reaches step[8] by running the same two commands the log
//  shows it running (install-deps, build-editor). The third test does the whole
//  thing again through a REAL pty login shell, a REAL git checkout and a REAL
//  bun workspace in a temp folder, so the gate is reached off the back of real
//  work with real exit codes rather than a scripted shell.
//
//  Two deliberate deviations from the wire, both about not touching the machine
//  the suite runs on:
//
//    * the `install-xcode` href is `https://apps-apple-com.invalid/...` instead
//      of `https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835`. Reaching the gate runs
//      `autoOpenIfTheStepPointsSomewhere`, and the real href is on
//      `ExternalLinkPolicy`'s allowlist, so a faithful copy would fling the Mac
//      App Store open on top of whoever is running the tests. `.invalid` is the
//      reserved never-resolving TLD; the host is not on the allowlist, so
//      `openLinkInBrowser` refuses it and returns false. The branch under test
//      is untouched by that - the open is best-effort and its result is
//      discarded either way - which the first test pins by asserting the real
//      App Store href IS allowed.
//    * the pty test's guide names the temp checkout as each step's
//      `workingDirectory` and runs `bun run sync` where the wire says
//      `bunx cap sync ios`, because the published step names `~/kneecap` and
//      Capacitor's CLI is a network fetch. Everything the gate depends on -
//      step kind, href, watch block, the order - is the wire's.
//
//  == HALF TWO: the simulator runtime ==
//
//  After the gate the reader asked chat about deploying, and the transcript
//  records thirteen turns of Iris pointing at a Git-branch dropdown and a
//  simulator choice that did not exist, reversing itself repeatedly, until at
//  07:18:10Z it finally noticed - from a screenshot, not from a fact - that
//  "Downloading iOS 26.5... 632.9 MB of 8.52 GB" was still in flight. `simctl`
//  on that Mac listed no runtime at all.
//
//  `AssistantMachineFacts.summary` is what chat is told about the machine, and
//  it reports `xcodebuild` - so the model is told Xcode is installed and is
//  told nothing whatsoever about whether anything can be run on it. There is no
//  `simctl` reference anywhere in the app. The last test states that asymmetry
//  against this Mac's REAL `xcrun simctl list runtimes -j` output.
