//
//  BUG 9, END TO END — "Pointing double-fire and stale coordinates after a
//  window move", measured once, at the boundary the reader can see.
//
//  `Bug9PointingDoubleFireReproTests` reproduces the two halves of this report
//  separately, and one of them (`theCorrectionFollowsTheWindowTheCaptureWas...`)
//  reaches `GuideStepPointingCoordinator.resolve` directly with a hand-built
//  locator. This file takes the reader's own path through the app once and
//  asserts what the reader would actually experience at the end of it:
//
//      * the assistant is called ONCE for the manual step they were parked on,
//        not two or three times inside half a second; and
//      * the eye lands on the control where the control IS, after they picked
//        the window up and put it down somewhere else while Iris was thinking.
//
//  Both in the same run, because in the field they happen in the same run: the
//  log's two asks 0.358s apart and its 2.6s round trip are one park of one step.
//  A guard that checks them apart cannot see the way they interact — every ask
//  spans a drag, only the LAST uncancelled ask's answer is ever flown, and a fix
//  to either half alone still leaves the eye on bare desktop.
//
//  HOW MUCH OF THIS IS REAL, stated plainly so nobody has to guess:
//
//    REAL. `GuideSessionController`, including its real
//    `NSWorkspace.didActivateApplicationNotification` observer and its real
//    400ms activation coalescer. The real `GuideAutopilotRunner` drive loop,
//    which walks the guide's three terminal steps and then takes the MANUAL
//    branch on `install-xcode` exactly as the field log does. The real
//    `GuideService` parsing a real HTTP response. The real `GuidePointingLadder`,
//    the real `GuideStepPointingCoordinator`, the real per-step model budget and
//    the real `GuideEyeFlightMemo`. Two REAL `NSPanel`s on the REAL screen, whose
//    live frames are what every locator answer is read from, one of which is
//    really moved between the capture and the answer.
//
//    STOOD IN FOR. (1) The model transport — `locateByAskingTheModel` stands in
//    for `CompanionManager.locateGuideTargetWithModel`, because that rung
//    captures the screen, costs money and needs grants this runner does not
//    have. It performs that method's geometry step for step: crop to the focused
//    window's frame at shutter time, wait out the round trip, then express the
//    answer through the crop origin it kept — which is the only geometry
//    `CompanionManager.globalScreenLocation` has. (2) The guide server, as a
//    `URLProtocol` serving the kneecap guide the log was installing, so the step
//    parked on is the field's step. (3) The pty shell, recorded rather than
//    spawned: what `bun install` does is not what this bug is about, and a real
//    login shell inside a timing-sensitive pointing measurement buys nothing.
//
//    HOW THE WINDOW IS MOVED. Through AppKit (`setFrameOrigin`), not through a
//    synthesized press-drag-release. That is not a shortcut taken here for
//    convenience: the sibling repro measured the synthesized gesture against
//    this same kind of panel and it moves it by exactly 0pt, because AppKit's
//    background-drag tracking loop pulls the rest of the gesture out of an event
//    queue the swiftc test runner has no `NSApplication` to pump (see
//    `Bug9PointingDoubleFireReproTests.theReaderMovesTheWindow`). The reader
//    moving their own window is this test's PREMISE, not the thing under test,
//    so it is done the way that actually moves a real window on the real window
//    server. The one event this runner does deliver for real — the app
//    activation Iris's own takeover window causes when it comes forward — is
//    posted on the real `NSWorkspace.shared.notificationCenter` and received by
//    the controller's real observer.
//
//  WHAT MAKES IT A GUARD RATHER THAN A RESTATEMENT. The app the reader is
//  working in has TWO windows open, which is what a real install target looks
//  like — a second Xcode window, a browser with two windows, any multi-document
//  editor. Only one of them is focused, and only that one is the window the
//  pointing capture crops to. The other sits perfectly still and is what this
//  app's window LIST (`locateWindow(ofApp:)`, `kAXWindowsAttribute`, whose order
//  Apple documents nothing about) hands back. So this test fails three separate
//  ways: if nothing coalesces the triggers, if nothing corrects for the move,
//  and if the correction measures the move of the wrong window.
