//
//  BUG 9 — "Pointing double-fire and stale coordinates after a window move."
//
//  THE FIELD EVIDENCE, verbatim from the cofounder's Mac (Iris 0.9.6 build 22,
//  `Iris_0.9.6_build_22_Test9_and_General_Logs_Credential_Redacted.log`,
//  process 51799, the kneecap install):
//
//      07:04:03.633  drive: step[7] id=build-editor kind=terminal exec=true
//      07:04:09.639  drive: build-editor result=succeeded
//      07:04:09.640  drive: step[8] id=install-xcode kind=open exec=false
//      07:04:09.861  drive: step install-xcode -> MANUAL branch, waiting at gate (return)
//      07:04:09.861  takeover: PARKED + set readerMustManuallyContinue=true, showsTerminalFace=true, title=Install Xcode
//      07:04:10.341  pointing/model: asked for step=Install Xcode
//      07:04:10.699  pointing/model: asked for step=Install Xcode
//      07:04:10.877  pointing/model: captured 1 screens, 1 cropped to the focused window
//      07:04:10.892  pointing/model: no point — i couldn't reach the assistant. check your connection and try again.
//      07:04:10.986  pointing/model: captured 1 screens, 1 cropped to the focused window
//      07:04:13.325  pointing/model: outcome=model-said-none coordinate=- screen=- modelLabel=none eyeWillAnnounce=Install Xcode
//      07:04:13.325  pointing/model: nothing to fly to (model-said-none)
//
//  and, from the same reports, the half the runtime never recorded a coordinate
//  for ("The runtime does not capture … exact pointer coordinates after the user
//  moves a window … The original Test 9 notes remain the evidence"): after the
//  reader MOVES a window, the eye flies to where the control WAS.
//
//  Both halves are reproduced against the SAME sequence of events the log
//  records, driven by the real machinery: the real `GuideSessionController`
//  (with its real `NSWorkspace` activation observer and its real 400ms
//  coalescer), the real `GuideAutopilotRunner` drive loop running the kneecap
//  guide's three terminal steps and then hitting `install-xcode`'s manual gate,
//  the real `GuidePointingLadder`, the real `GuideStepPointingCoordinator`, the
//  real `GuideService` answering from a stubbed URL protocol that serves the
//  guide the log was installing, and the real `GuideEyeFlightMemo` inside the
//  controller. Stood in for: the pty shell (a recorder — what a command does is
//  not what this bug is about), the pointing model (it costs money and needs a
//  granted Mac), and the reader's own window, which is a REAL `NSPanel` on the
//  REAL screen, really moved mid-ask.
//
//  WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, and why each assertion is the bug rather than a
//  restatement of the code:
//
//  (a) SEVERAL MODEL ASKS FOR ONE UNCHANGED STEP, INSIDE HALF A SECOND. One
//      manual step is parked exactly once, and THREE separate triggers reach
//      `GuideSessionController.refreshPointingForTheOpenStep()` in that window
//      — none of which knows the other two exist:
//
//        1. the step-change refresh. The command before the gate succeeds, and
//           `advanceFromWithinAutopilot` -> `advanceToTheNextStep()` carries a
//           `defer { refreshPointingForTheOpenStep() }` (GuideSessionController
//           line 2546). The reader has landed on `install-xcode`.
//
//        2. the park's own refresh. The same drive-loop iteration then takes the
//           MANUAL branch for that step and calls
//           `handTheCurrentStepBackToTheReader()`, whose last line is
//           `refreshPointingForTheOpenStep()` (line 1969) — "fly the eye to
//           whatever the step points at, so a non-technical reader is shown
//           where to act". Same step, same target, one main-actor turn later.
//
//        3. the app-activation refresh. The very next statement in that branch
//           is `onAutopilotWaitingForReaderAtGate?(...)`, which is what
//           `CompanionManager` uses to raise and park the takeover terminal —
//           a window coming forward. `NSWorkspace.didActivateApplicationNotification`
//           is posted for the OBSERVING app's own activation too, so Iris's own
//           panel feeds `refreshPointingOnceAppActivationsHaveSettled`, whose
//           400ms quiet period then expires on the same unchanged step.
//
//      This test therefore posts that activation from inside the gate callback:
//      the same statement of the same branch, in the same order the field ran
//      it. (Posting is the honest simulation — the swiftc test runner has no
//      `NSApplication` session for the window server to activate, so the
//      notification AppKit would post is posted directly, on the same
//      `NSWorkspace.shared.notificationCenter` the controller really observes.)
//
//      MEASURED HERE: asks at +0.000s, +0.000s and +0.427s from the park — the
//      first two from the same main-actor turn (1 and 2), the third when the
//      coalescer's quiet period expires (3). The cofounder's log records two
//      asks 0.358s apart rather than three; which of these triggers reached the
//      paid rung on his Mac depends on what `GuidePointingLadder.decide` said at
//      each instant, and the log does not carry that. Two or three, it is one
//      defect and one count: nothing coordinates callers that are asking about
//      the same unchanged step.
//
//      Neither trigger knows about the others. Every call does
//      `pointingTask?.cancel()` and then starts a brand-new task, and Swift task
//      cancellation is cooperative: the only `Task.isCancelled` check on this
//      path sits AFTER `await GuideStepPointingCoordinator.resolve(...)` has
//      already run to completion, so the first ask's real capture and real HTTPS
//      round trip are neither stopped nor merged. Both asks complete — that is
//      what the log's two independent outcomes 2.4s apart show — and both spend
//      the step's model budget, which is why `maximumModelPointingAsksPerStep`
//      does not catch this either: two legitimate reservations, two real asks.
//
//      The fake model here therefore refuses to abort on cancellation (see
//      `waitOutAnUncancellableRoundTrip`): a `try? await Task.sleep` would unwind
//      the instant `cancel()` set the flag and would flatter the unfixed code
//      into looking as though the cancel had worked. A JPEG that has been
//      captured and a request that is on the wire do not come back.
//
//  (b) A COORDINATE THAT DESCRIBES A WINDOW WHERE IT USED TO BE. For an inferred
//      target the answer comes from `CompanionManager.locateGuideTargetWithModel`,
//      which crops the capture to the focused window's frame *at capture time*
//      (`CompanionScreenCaptureUtility.focusedWindowWorthCroppingTo` ->
//      `CompanionScreenCaptureWindowCrop.regionInFullScreenshotPixels`), keeps
//      only that pixel crop region, and then — 2.6 seconds later, on the log's
//      own numbers — maps the model's in-image coordinate back to a global point
//      through that same stale crop origin
//      (`CompanionManager.globalScreenLocation(fromScreenshotPoint:screenNumber:in:)`).
//      Nothing between the capture and the flight asks whether the window is
//      still there. Drag it while the model is thinking and the eye is off by
//      exactly the drag delta.
//
//      The fake model performs that production geometry step for step, against a
//      REAL `NSPanel` really moved on the real screen mid-ask. The assertion is
//      at the boundary the reader can see — the point handed to
//      `GuideSessionController.sendTheEyeTo`.
//
//      NOTE FOR WHOEVER FIXES THIS. The correction has to be visible at that
//      boundary, and this test deliberately leaves a seam for it that exists in
//      the shipped protocol already: `GuideTargetLocating.locateWindow(ofApp:)`
//      answers where a window is NOW, and here it is wired to the live panel
//      frame, exactly as `SystemGuideTargetLocator` answers from the live
//      accessibility tree. Nothing calls it for an inferred target today (see
//      `GuideStepPointingCoordinator.resolve`: the window rung is gated on
//      `target.isWindow`), which is why wiring it changes nothing about the
//      failure below. A fix that corrects the point only INSIDE
//      `locateGuideTargetWithModel` — behind the `askTheModel` closure this test,
//      like every pointing test in the suite, necessarily stands in for — cannot
//      be seen from here and will leave this red.
