//
//  The L6 adversarial reviewer (plan §9, decision 3a) is the last gate before a
//  change may claim "independently reviewed", so its two pure pieces must hold
//  exactly: the prompt asks the fresh-context reviewer for the reply shape the
//  parser reads (they must not drift), and the parser is FAIL-CLOSED — it clears
//  a change for L6 ONLY on an explicit, issue-free clean verdict, and withholds
//  the rung on every other shape (disqualifying, contradictory, or unreadable).
//  Pure logic, no processes.
