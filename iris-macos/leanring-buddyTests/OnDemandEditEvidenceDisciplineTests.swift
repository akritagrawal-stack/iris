//  The four guards added after the WhimprFlow post-mortem, where five
//  consecutive on-demand runs each reported a fixed bug and left the user's
//  complaint exactly where it was.
//
//  What actually happened: the installed app was ad-hoc signed, so its
//  designated requirement was a bare hash of the binary. macOS records that
//  requirement when a permission is granted, so every rebuild made the app a
//  different client to TCC and silently dropped the Accessibility grant —
//  while System Settings kept showing the switch on. The cause was never in
//  the source, and every run looked only at the source. Each then "verified"
//  its change with a grep for the line it had just written, and wrote its
//  invented cause into memory, where the next run read it as established.
//
//  These tests pin the four places that let that happen.
