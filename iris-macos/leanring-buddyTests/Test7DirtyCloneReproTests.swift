//
//  THE REPORT. Test 7, Akrit, Iris 0.9.1 build 17. He asked for two features on
//  an app he had installed from a publik guide. Both were rejected before
//  anything ran, both with the same sentence:
//
//      "your clone has uncommitted changes — commit or stash them first so
//       Iris never touches your own work"
//
//  and his answer was:
//
//      "i made no changes this doesn't make sense as to why that is the error."
//
//  He was telling the truth AND so was Iris. Runtime inspection of his clone
//  found exactly ONE modification, dated Aug 25 — left behind by an earlier
//  build or guide run, not by him. The refusal was correct and still failed
//  him, for three separate reasons, which are the three suites below:
//
//    1. IT NAMED NOTHING. Iris had just run `git status --porcelain` — it was
//       holding the filename — and each file's date is one `stat` away. It
//       discarded both before speaking, so a reader who had made no changes had
//       no way to see that the sentence was not about him.
//    2. IT WAS A DEAD END. "commit or stash them first" is a shell instruction
//       handed to somebody working in a GUI, and stashing is something Iris can
//       do itself in one tap while HONORING the never-touch-your-work rule
//       better than a dead end does — a stash preserves the work; refusing
//       preserves it and delivers nothing.
//    3. HE COULD NOT COPY IT. "i can't copy paste text on that tab with the
//       error" — a straight regression of the same complaint from Test 4. Every
//       reader-facing line on a failure / blocked / refusal card needs
//       `.textSelection(.enabled)`; the committed-diff block had it and nothing
//       else on the card did.
//
//  The first suite drives the REAL coordinator against a REAL git clone holding
//  a REAL stale modification, so the sentence under test is the one the reader
//  gets rather than a reconstruction of it.
