//  THE READER'S WORDS (Test 7 field report, Iris 0.9.1 build 17):
//
//      "The I did it - continue button is not working when trying to install
//       cmake."
//
//  and the same gate, reported once already in Test 6, on a permission grant
//  for WhimprFlow. Runtime telemetry from his run: at the CMake gate Iris was
//  parked with `readerMustManuallyContinue = true` and nothing ever advanced —
//  the install only moved again after he quit and relaunched the app.
//
//  These tests drive the REAL `GuideSessionController` — its real drive loop,
//  its real advance, its real resume — against a scripted shell, to the exact
//  shape the reader hit: whimprflow's macOS toolchain authors `install-rust`
//  (kind `open`) immediately followed by `install-cmake` (kind `open`), two
//  manual gates back to back, and then the install's own commands.
//
//  WHAT THEY CAUGHT AT HEAD, stated exactly:
//
//   - ONE press at a gate already resumed the install (the first two tests
//     passed before any change). Say that plainly rather than claiming a fix
//     for something that was working.
//   - TWO presses did NOT. `advanceToTheNextStep` increments unconditionally,
//     while `resumeAutopilotAfterAdvance` refuses to re-enter a drive loop that
//     is already in flight — so the second press walked the reader past the
//     step immediately after the gate and that step was NEVER RUN. The only
//     outward sign is a step counter creeping upward with nothing happening,
//     which is what a reader sees as a button that does nothing, and it is the
//     shape his own forensics recorded: parked at the CMake gate, nothing
//     running, and a relaunch that picked up three steps further on.
//   - The resume-position check moved him BACKWARDS into that gate in the
//     first place, mid-install. That is his runtime finding #1 verbatim, and
//     the last test here pins it.
//   - The press wrote NOTHING to `iris.log` in either direction, which is why
//     his forensics could only say "No same-process continuation was logged".
