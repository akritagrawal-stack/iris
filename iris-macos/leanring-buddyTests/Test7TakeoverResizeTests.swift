//
//  THE READER'S WORDS (Test 7 field report, Iris 0.9.1 build 17):
//
//      "You cannot resize the terminal tab."
//
//  True at HEAD by construction, and measured: the takeover terminal is a
//  `[.borderless, .nonactivatingPanel]` window whose every frame comes from
//  `GuideAutopilotTakeoverController` (`terminalSizedFrame` 760x480,
//  `parkedFrame` 400x340). `styleMask.contains(.resizable)` is false, there is
//  no title bar to grab, and — the part that would have defeated `.resizable`
//  even if it were set — `GuideAutopilotTakeoverTerminalPanel.sendEvent` HOLDS
//  every left mouse-down for its own drag-tracking loop, so a press on the
//  window's edge never survives to reach AppKit's own resize handling. Dragging
//  an edge slid the whole window instead.
//
//  So the resize is implemented in that same tracking loop, next to the move,
//  and these tests drive it the way `Test6TakeoverPanelReproTests` drives the
//  drag: a real gesture posted at the real panel, with the window frame read
//  back afterwards.
