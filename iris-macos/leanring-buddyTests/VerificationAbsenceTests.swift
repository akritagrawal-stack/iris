//  The three places where "this stage did not happen" and "this stage happened
//  and passed" used to be the SAME value, so nothing downstream could tell
//  them apart and every missing signal read as a green one.
//
//    1. A build stage with no build command set `buildSucceeded = true`.
//    2. A zero-file diff answered the scope gate with "ok".
//    3. A commit script whose result was discarded returned a branch name.
//
//  Each test below fails against the code as it was and passes against the
//  code as it is. The first is pure; the second and third spawn real `git`
//  against throwaway repos, so they are serialized alongside the other
//  process-spawning suites.
