//
//  The gate every command passes before the autopilot shell will run it.
//
//  Be clear-eyed about what this is: a guardrail against mistakes, not a
//  defence against an adversary. Regexes over command text are defeatable by
//  construction — `$(echo rm) -rf` says nothing that matches `rm -rf` — which
//  is exactly why obfuscation itself trips the gate rather than being chased
//  pattern by pattern. The real security boundary is provenance: guide
//  commands come only from HTTPS-fetched, version-pinned guide JSON that the
//  web repo's tests already vet, and fix commands come from a model call
//  whose schema and system prompt constrain it. This file exists so that a
//  vetting regression or a bad fix pauses for a human instead of running.
//
//  Three tiers, not two. A confirm tap is not informed consent for
//  `curl … | sh` — the reader cannot read what is on the other end — so the
//  handful of commands no tap can justify are refused outright and the
//  button never appears.
//
//  `GuideAutopilotApprovedCommand` is the only type the shell session will
//  accept, and its initialiser is private: the two mint functions below are
//  the only way to obtain one. "Run an unassessed command" is therefore not
//  something the code can express — the same structural enforcement
//  `AssistantTransport` uses for the BYO key.
//
//  ── The gate assesses the command AS IT WILL RUN ──
//
//  Every rule below is a pattern over command TEXT, and the text of a command
//  does not say where it runs. That was a real hole the moment a guide step
//  could declare its own working directory: `cp -R ./Evil.app /Applications/`
//  asks for a confirm tap, and the identical effect written as
//  `workingDirectory: "/Applications"` + `cp -R ./Evil.app .` used to run with
//  no tap at all. Measured, before the fix, from this file's own compiled gate:
//
//      cp -R ./Evil.app /Applications/                      -> CONFIRM
//      cd /Applications ; cp -R ./Evil.app .                -> CONFIRM
//      cp ./x.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/x.plist           -> CONFIRM
//      cd /Library/LaunchAgents ; cp ./x.plist x.plist      -> CONFIRM
//      rm -rf ~                              (grant ON)     -> REFUSED (floor)
//      cd ~ ; rm -rf .                       (grant ON)     -> REFUSED
//
//  The last pair is the worst of them: the catastrophe floor is the one thing
//  no consent and no autonomy grant can wave through, and a declared folder
//  walked a whole-home deletion straight past it.
//
//  So `assess` now takes the folder the command will run in and checks every
//  rule against TWO renderings — the raw text, exactly as before, and the same
//  command with its relative paths resolved against that folder. The strictest
//  verdict wins. Resolution is used only for judging; the text that actually
//  reaches the shell is never rewritten, so a rendering this gets wrong can
//  only ever cost an extra confirm tap, never change what runs.

    //
    // Reported from two machines: "Got stuck on the same problem with homebrew
    // installation, it won't install homebrew if it is not already installed"
    // and "It still doesn't know what to do if i don't have homebrew
    // installed." Without the grant, rustup's own one-liner is a `curl … | sh`
    // and this gate refused it outright, so a guide could only open a web page
    // and hope; Homebrew's fared little better, tripping the obfuscation rule
    // on its `$(` and stopping for a tap. The founder's call: "relax homebrew
    // shit allow them to just install homebrew and rustup in like through the
    // terminal commands."
    //
    // The allowance is the WHOLE COMMAND, matched literally. The alternative
    // shapes were both worse. Loosening `\b(curl|wget)\b … \|` would reopen
    // download-and-run generally, which is the one thing no confirm tap can
    // make informed — the reader cannot read what is on the other end. And an
    // allowlist of hosts would wave through
    // `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/../../evil/x.sh`,
    // which is on the official host and is not the official script. Matching
    // the whole string also means a chained `… | sh && sudo …` never matches,
    // so nothing rides in behind the allowance.
    //
    // Widening this is a visible edit to a four-line list rather than a regex
    // tweak whose blast radius nobody can see. Spelled identically in
    // lib/guide-invariants.ts (`OFFICIAL_INSTALLER_COMMANDS`), which is the
    // gate the same command passes on the web side before it can be published.
